      iswc:abstract
            "This paper describes two approaches for automatically converting RDF Schema 
and RuleML sources into an inference engine and storage repository. Rather than 
using traditional inference systems, our solution bases on mainstream 
technologies like Java and relational database systems. While this necessarily 
imposes some restrictions, the ease of integration into an existing IT landscape 
is a major advantage. We present the conversion tools and their limitations. 
Furthermore, an extension to RuleML is proposed, that allows Java-enabled 
reaction rules, where calls to Java libraries can be performed upon a rule 
firing. This requires hosts to be Java-enabled when rules and code are moved 
across the web. However, the solution allows for great engineering 
flexibility." ;

            "RDF provides a basic way to represent data for the Semantic Web. We have 
      been experimenting with the query paradigm for working with RDF data in

      access mechanism that is suitable for application usage and remote 
      access. We describe work on a conceptual model for querying RDF data 
      that refines ideas first presented in at the W3C workshop on Query

      that is suitable for application programmers. Further, we present

      iswc:abstract
            "A marketplace is 
      the place in which the demand and supply of buyers and vendors 
      participating in a business process may meet. Therefore, electronic 
      marketplaces are virtual communities in which buyers may meet proposals 
      of several suppliers and make the best choice. In the electronic 
      commerce world, the comparison between different products is blocked due 
      to the lack of standards (on the contrary, the proliferation of 
      standards) describing and classifying them. Therefore, the need for B2B 
      and B2C marketplaces is to reclassify products and goods according to 
      different standardization models. This paper aims to face this problem 
      by suggesting the use of a semi-automatic methodology, supported by a 
      tool (SI-Designer), to define the mapping among different e-commerce 
      product classification standards. This methodology was developed for the 
      MOMIS-system within the Intelligent Integration of Information research 
      area. We describe our extension to the methodology that makes it 
      applyable in general to product classification standard, by selecting a 
      fragment of ECCMA/UNSPSC and ecl@ss standard." ;

            "This paper describes an approach to derive assessments about information 
      sources based on individual feedback about the sources. We describe 
      TRELLIS, a system that helps users annotate their analysis of 
      alternative information sources that can be contradictory and 
      incomplete. As the user makes a decision on which sources to dismiss and 
      which to believe in making a final decision, TRELLIS captures the 
      derivation of the decision in a semantic markup. TRELLIS then uses these 
      annotations to derive an assessment of the source based on the 
      annotations of many individuals. Our work builds on the Semantic Web and 
      presents a tool that helps users create annotations that are in a mix of 
      formal and human language, and exploits the formal representations to 
      derive measures of trust in the content of Web resources and their 
      original source." ;

      paper we discuss the process of discovering the<br>maps between two 
      vocabularies assuming availability of two sets of<br>documents, each 
      using one of the vocabularies. We take the<br>vocabularies of product
