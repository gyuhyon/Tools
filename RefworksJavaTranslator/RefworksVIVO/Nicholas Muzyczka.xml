<ab>Nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were continuously delivered to the striatum at biologically active levels via recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) gene transfer 4-5 weeks prior to 30 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The magnitude of the deficits in a battery of behavioral tests designed to assess striatal function was highly correlated to the extent of ischemic damage determined by unbiased stereological estimations of striatal neuron numbers. The delivery of neurotrophins lead to mild functional improvements in the ischemia-induced motor impairments assessed 3-5 weeks after the insult, in agreement with a small but significant increase of the survival of dorsolateral striatal neurons. Detailed phenotypic analysis demonstrated that the parvalbumin-containing interneurons were spared to a greater extent by the neurotrophin treatment as compared to the projection neurons, which agreed with the specificity for interneuron transduction by the rAAV vector. These data show the advantage of the never previously performed combination of precise quantification of the ischemia-induced neuropathology along with detailed behavioural analysis for assessing neuroprotection after stroke. We observe that intrastriatal delivery of NGF and BDNF using a viral vector system can mitigate, albeit only moderately, neuronal death following stroke, which leads to detectable functional sparing.</ab>

<ab>A phase I trial of intramuscular injection of a recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (rAAV2) alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) vector was performed in 12 AAT-deficient adults, 10 of whom were male. All subjects were either homozygous for the most common AAT mutation (a missense mutation designated PI*Z) or compound heterozygous for PI*Z and another mutation known to cause disease. There were four dose cohorts, ranging from 2.1 x 10(12) vector genomes (VG) to 6.9 x 10(13) VG, with three subjects per cohort. Subjects were injected sequentially in a dose-escalating fashion with a minimum of 14 days between patients. Subjects who had been receiving AAT protein replacement discontinued that therapy 28 days before vector administration. There were no vector-related serious adverse events in any of the 12 participants. Vector DNA sequences were detected in the blood between 1 and 3 days after injection in nearly all patients receiving doses of 6.9 x 10(12) VG or higher. Anti-AAV2 capsid antibodies were present and rose after vector injection, but no other immune responses were detected. One subject who had not been receiving protein replacement exhibited low-level expression of wild-type M-AAT in the serum (82 nM), which was detectable 30 days after receiving an injection of 2.1 x 10(13) VG. Unfortunately, residual but declining M-AAT levels from the washout of the protein replacement elevated background levels sufficiently to obscure any possible vector expression in that range in most of the other individuals in the higher dose cohorts.</ab>

<ab>The single-stranded adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV) genome is flanked by terminal repeats (TRs) that fold back on themselves to form hairpinned structures. During AAV DNA replication, the TRs are nicked by the virus-encoded Rep proteins at the terminal resolution site (trs). This origin function apparently requires three sequence elements, the Rep binding element (RBE), a small palindrome that comprises a single tip of an internal hairpin within the TR (RBE&amp;#39;), and the trs. Previously, we determined the sequences at the trs required for Rep-mediated cleavage and demonstrated that the trs endonuclease reaction occurs in two discrete steps. In the first step, the Rep DNA helicase activity unwinds the TR, thereby extruding a stem-loop structure at the trs. In the second step, Rep transesterification activity cleaves the trs. Here we investigate the contribution of the RBE and RBE&amp;#39; during this process. Our data indicate that Rep is tethered to the RBE in a specific orientation during trs nicking. This orientation appears to align Rep on the AAV TR, allowing specific nucleotide contacts with the RBE&amp;#39; and directing nicking to the trs. Accordingly, alterations in the polarity or position of the RBE relative to the trs greatly inhibit Rep nicking. Substitutions within the RBE&amp;#39; also reduce Rep specific activity, but to a lesser extent. Interestingly, Rep interactions with the RBE and RBE&amp;#39; during nicking seem to be functionally distinct. Rep contacts with the RBE appear necessary for both the DNA helicase and trs cleavage steps of the endonuclease reaction. On the other hand, RBE&amp;#39; contacts seem to be required primarily for TR unwinding and formation of the trs stem-loop structure, not cleavage. Together, these results suggest a model of Rep interaction with the AAV TR during origin nicking through a tripartite cleavage signal comprised of the RBE, the RBE&amp;#39;, and the trs.</ab>

<ab>The single-stranded adeno-associated virus (AAV) genome is flanked by terminal hairpinned origins of DNA replication (terminal repeats [TRs]) that are nicked at the terminal resolution site (trs) by the AAV Rep protein in an ATP-dependent, site-specific manner. Here we determine the minimal trs sequence necessary for Rep cleavage, 3&amp;#39;-CCGGT/TG-5&amp;#39;, and show that this 7-base core sequence is required only on the nicked strand. We also identify a potential stem-loop structure at the trs. Interestingly, Rep nicking on a TR substrate that fixes this trs stem-loop in the extruded form no longer requires ATP. This suggests that ATP-dependent Rep helicase activity is necessary to unwind the duplex trs and extrude the stem-loop structure, prior to the ATP-independent Rep transesterification reaction. The extrusion of origin stem-loop structures prior to nicking appears to be a general mechanism shared by plant and animal viruses and bacterial plasmids. In the case of AAV, this mechanism of TR nicking would provide a possible regulatory function.</ab>

<ab>Recombinant adeno-associated virus 2 (rAAV2) has been shown to deliver genes to neurons effectively in the brain, retina, and spinal cord. The characterization of new AAV serotypes has revealed that they have different patterns of transduction in diverse tissues. We have investigated the tropism and transduction frequency in the central nervous system (CNS) of three different rAAV vector serotypes. The vectors contained AAV2 terminal repeats flanking a green fluorescent protein expression cassette under the control of the synthetic CBA promoter, in AAV1, AAV2, or AAV5 capsids, producing the pseudotypes rAAV2/1, rAAV2/2, and rAAV2/5. Rats were injected with rAAV2/1, rAAV2/2, or rAAV2/5 into selected regions of the CNS, including the hippocampus (HPC), substantia nigra (SN), striatum, globus pallidus, and spinal cord. In all regions injected, the three vectors transduced neurons almost exclusively. All three vectors transduced the SN pars compacta with high efficiency, but rAAV2/1 and rAAV2/5 also transduced the pars reticulata. Moreover, rAAV2/1 showed widespread distribution throughout the entire midbrain. In the HPC, rAAV2/1 and rAAV2/5 targeted the pyramidal cell layers in the CA1-CA3 regions, whereas AAV2/2 primarily transduced the hilar region of the dentate gyrus. In general, rAAV2/1 and rAAV2/5 exhibited higher transduction frequencies than rAAV2/2 in all regions injected, although the differences were marginal in some regions. Retrograde transport of rAAV1 and rAAV5 was also observed in particular CNS areas. These results suggest that vectors based on distinct AAV serotypes can be chosen for specific applications in the nervous system.</ab>

<ab>We have previously described the transcriptional changes that occur in the hippocampal CA1 field of aged rats following a Morris Water Maze (MWM) training paradigm. In this report we proceed with the analysis of the dentate region from the same animals. Animals were first identified as age learning-impaired or age-superior learners when compared to young rats based on their performance in the MWM. Messenger RNA was isolated from the dentate gyrus of each animal to interrogate Affymetrix RAE 230A rat genome microarrays. Microarray profiling identified 1129 genes that were differentially expressed between aged and young rats as a result of aging, and independent of their behavioral training (p&amp;lt;0.005). We applied Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) algorithms to identify the significant biological processes underlying age-related changes in the dentate gyrus. The most significant functions, as calculated by IPA, included cell movement, cell growth and proliferation, nervous system development and function, cellular assembly and organization, cell morphology and cell death. These significant processes are consistent with age-related changes in neurogenesis, and the neurogenic markers were generally found to be downregulated in senescent animals. In addition, statistical analysis of the different experimental groups of aged animals recognized 85 genes (p&amp;lt;0.005) that were different in the dentate gyrus of aged rats that had learned the MWM when compared to learning impaired and a number of controls for stress, exercise and non-spatial learning. The list of learning-related genes expressed in the dentate adds to the set of genes we previously described in the CA1 region. This long list of genes constitutes a starting tool to elucidating the molecular pathways involved in learning and memory formation.</ab>

<ab>Aged rats display a broad range of behavioral performance in spatial learning. The aim of this study was to identify candidate genes that are associated with learning and memory impairments. We first categorized aged-superior learners and age learning-impaired rats based on their performance in the Morris water maze (MWM) and then isolated messenger RNA from the CA1 hippocampal region of each animal to interrogate Affymetrix microarrays. Microarray analysis identified a set of 50 genes that was transcribed differently in aged-superior learners that had successfully learned the spatial strategy in the MWM compared to aged learning-impaired animals that were unable to learn and a variety of groups designed to control for all non-learning aspects of exposure to the water maze paradigm. A detailed analysis of the navigation patterns of the different groups of animals during acquisition and probe trials of the MWM task was performed. Young animals used predominantly an allocentric (spatial) search strategy and aged-superior learners appeared to use a combination of allocentric and egocentric (response) strategies, whereas aged-learning impaired animals displayed thigmotactic behavior. The significant 50 genes that we identified were tentatively classified into four groups based on their putative role in learning: transcription, synaptic morphology, ion conductivity and protein modification. Thus, this study has potentially identified a set of genes that are responsible for the learning impairments in aged rats. The role of these genes in the learning impairments associated with aging will ultimately have to be validated by manipulating gene expression in aged rats. Finally, these 50 genes were functioning in the context of an aging CA1 region where over 200 genes was found to be differentially expressed compared to a young CA1.</ab>

<ab>Dyskinesias are a major complication of long-term l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) treatment in Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease, and are believed to result from the intermittent and pulsatile supply of L-DOPA. Daily injections of L-DOPA can prime similar abnormal involuntary movements of the limb, orolingual and axial muscles in rats rendered parkinsonian by destruction of the nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) neurons. In this study we used 33 rats with severe nigrostriatal dopamine depletion and showed that in vivo gene transfer of the DA-synthetic enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1) using recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors can provide a constant source of DOPA production locally in the striatum, at a level that is effective in reducing L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias by &amp;gt;85%, and reverse lesion-induced motor impairments. Furthermore, the abnormal expression of DeltaFosB, prodynorphin and preproenkephalin mRNA within the striatal projection neurons normally seen in dyskinetic animals was completely reversed by TH-GCH1 gene transfer. These findings form a strong basis for replacing, or supplementing, conventional systemic L-DOPA therapy by continuous intrastriatal DOPA using in vivo gene transfer in the treatment of patients with advanced Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease.</ab>

<ab>Reduction of Abeta deposition is a major therapeutic strategy in Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease (AD). The concentration of Abeta in the brain is modulated not only by Abeta production but also by its degradation. One of the proteases involved in the degradation of Abeta peptides is endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE). In this study, we investigated the effects of an intracranial administration of a seroptype 5 recombinant adeno-associated viral vector (rAAV) containing the ECE-1 synthetic gene on amyloid deposition in amyloid precursor protein (APP) plus presenilin-1 (PS1) transgenic mice. The rAAV vector was injected unilaterally into the right anterior cortex and hippocampus of 6-month-old mice, while control mice received an AAV vector expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP). Immunohistochemical testing for the hemagglutinin (HA) tag appended to ECE revealed strong expression in areas surrounding the injection sites but minimal expression in the contralateral regions. Immunohistochemical tests showed that Abeta decreases in the anterior cortex and hippocampus in mice receiving the ECE synthetic gene. Further, decreases in Congo red positive deposits were also observed in both regions. These results indicate that increasing the expression of beta-amyloid degrading enzymes through gene therapy is a promising approach to the treatment of AD.</ab>

<ab>Recombinant adeno-associated virus type 2 (rAAV) vectors have recently been used to achieve long-term, high level transduction in vivo. Further development of rAAV vectors for clinical use requires significant technological improvements in large-scale vector production. In order to facilitate the production of rAAV vectors, a recombinant herpes simplex virus type I vector (rHSV-1) which does not produce ICP27, has been engineered to express the AAV-2 rep and cap genes. The optimal dose of this vector, d27.1-rc, for AAV production has been determined and results in a yield of 380 expression units (EU) of AAV-GFP produced from 293 cells following transfection with AAV-GFP plasmid DNA. In addition, d27.1-rc was also efficient at producing rAAV from cell lines that have an integrated AAV-GFP provirus. Up to 480 EU/cell of AAV-GFP could be produced from the cell line GFP-92, a proviral, 293 derived cell line. Effective amplification of rAAV vectors introduced into 293 cells by infection was also demonstrated. Passage of rAAV with d27. 1-rc results in up to 200-fold amplification of AAV-GFP with each passage after coinfection of the vectors. Efficient, large-scale production (&amp;gt;109 cells) of AAV-GFP from a proviral cell line was also achieved and these stocks were free of replication-competent AAV. The described rHSV-1 vector provides a novel, simple and flexible way to introduce the AAV-2 rep and cap genes and helper virus functions required to produce high-titer rAAV preparations from any rAAV proviral construct. The efficiency and potential for scalable delivery of d27.1-rc to producer cell cultures should facilitate the production of sufficient quantities of rAAV vectors for clinical application.</ab>

<ab>Recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) type 2 (rAAV) vectors have recently been shown to have great utility as gene transfer agents both in vitro and in vivo. One of the problems associated with the use of rAAV vectors has been the difficulty of large-scale vector production. Low-efficiency plasmid transfection of the rAAV vector and complementing AAV type 2 (AAV-2) functions (rep and cap) followed by superinfection with adenovirus has been the standard approach to rAAV production. The objectives of this study were to demonstrate the ability of a recombinant herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) amplicon expressing AAV-2 Rep and Cap to support replication and packaging of rAAV vectors. HSV-1 amplicon vectors were constructed which contain the AAV-2 rep and cap genes under control of their native promoters (p5, p19, and p40). An HSV-1 amplicon vector, HSV-RC/KOS or HSV-RC/d27, was generated by supplying helper functions with either wild-type HSV-1 (KOS strain) or the ICP27-deleted mutant of HSV-1, d27-1, respectively. Replication of the amplicon stocks is not inhibited by the presence of AAV-2 Rep proteins, which highlights important differences between HSV-1 and adenovirus replication and the mechanism of providing helper function for productive AAV infection. Coinfection of rAAV and HSV-RC/KOS resulted in the replication and amplification of rAAV genomes. Similarly, rescue and replication of rAAV genomes occurred when rAAV vector plasmids were transfected into cells followed by HSV-RC/KOS infection and when two rAAV proviral cell lines were infected with HSV-RC/KOS or HSV-RC/d27. Production of infectious rAAV by rescue from two rAAV proviral cell lines has also been achieved with HSV-RC/KOS and HSV-RC/d27. The particle titer of rAAV produced with HSV-RC/d27 is equal to that achieved by supplying rep and cap by transfection followed by adenovirus superinfection. Importantly, no detectable wild-type AAV-2 is generated with this approach. These results demonstrate that an HSV-1 amplicon expressing the AAV-2 genes rep and cap along with HSV-1 helper functions supports the replication and packaging of rAAV vectors in a scaleable process.</ab>

<ab>Organ-specific expression of a cre recombinase transgene allows for the analysis of gene function in a particular tissue or cell type. Using a 4.6 kb promoter from the mouse glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit (alphaGSU or Cga) gene, we have generated and characterized a line of transgenic mice that express cre recombinase in the anterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary gland. Utilizing a cre-responsive reporter transgene, alphaGSU-cre transgene expression was detected in the pituitary primordium and in all five cell types of the adult anterior pituitary. alphaGSU-cre transgene activity was also detected in the cardiac and skeletal muscle. Little or no activity was evident in the gonads, adrenal glands, brain, ventromedial hypothalamus, or kidneys. The alphaGSU-cre transgenic mice characterized here will be a valuable tool for examining gene function in the pituitary gland.</ab>

<ab>For many metabolic diseases, early correction of the inherited deficiency is required to prevent long-term sequelae. We examined the ability of adeno-associated virus (AAV) to mediate efficient gene transfer during the neonatal period in mice with the lysosomal storage disease mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (MPS VII). Quadriceps of newborn MPS VII mice were injected with an AAV vector containing human beta-glucuronidase (GUSB) cDNA. High-level intramuscular GUSB expression was seen as early as 2 weeks of age, and persisted for at least 16 weeks with no reduction in activity. In addition, GUSB activity was detected in both liver and spleen at later time points. The level of GUSB activity resulted in a significant reduction in lysosomal storage in the liver and a minimal reduction in the spleen at 16 weeks. However, the temporal and spatial pattern of hepatic GUSB activity, coupled with the presence of GUSB cDNA in liver sections, suggests that hematogenous dissemination of virus at the time of injection led to gene transfer to hepatic cells. These results demonstrate that AAV vectors can successfully infect neonatal muscle and persist through the rapid growth phase following birth. However, GUSB secretion from an intramuscular source is inefficient, limiting the therapeutic efficacy of this approach.</ab>

<ab>We investigated the long-term effects of physiological levels of leptin produced by gene therapy on body weight (BW) and expression of genes that encode orexigenic and anorexigenic peptides in the hypothalamus. Recombinant adeno-associated viral vector (rAAV), a non-pathogenic and non-immunogenic vector, encoding leptin (betaOb) was generated and administered iv to ob/ob mice lacking endogenous leptin. Whereas the lowest dose of rAAV-betaOb (6x10(9) particles) was ineffective, the middle dose (6x10(10) particles) curbed BW gain without affecting food consumption for 75 days of observation. A ten-fold higher dose (6x10(11) particles) resulted in increased blood leptin levels and suppressed both BW gain and food consumption throughout the duration of the experiment. rAAV-betaOb doses that either curbed BW without affecting food consumption or evoked BW loss and reduced food intake, decreased the expression of genes encoding the orexigenic peptides, neuropeptide Y and agouti-related peptide in the ARC, and the two doses were equally effective. Concomitantly, the expression of genes encoding the anorexigenic peptide, alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone and cocaine-and-amphetamine regulatory transcript, was augmented with the latter gene displaying a dose-dependant response. These results document the efficacy of delivering biologically active leptin for extended periods by an iv injection of rAAV-betaOb and show that physiological leptin concentrations simultaneously exert a tonic inhibitory effect on orexigenic and a stimulatory effect on anorexigenic signaling in the hypothalamus. This intricate dynamic interplay induced by leptin regulates BW with or without an effect on food intake in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Further, these results suggest that gene therapy is an effective mode of delivery to the hypothalamus of those therapeutic proteins that cross the blood-brain barrier to ameliorate neuroendocrine disorders.</ab>

<ab>The weight-reducing effects of leptin are predominantly mediated through the hypothalamus in the brain. Gene therapy strategies designed for weight control have so far tested the short-term effect of peripherally delivered viral vectors encoding the leptin gene. In order to circumvent the multiple peripheral effects of hyperleptinemia and to overcome the age-related development of leptin resistance due to multiple factors, including defective leptin transport across the blood brain barrier, we determined whether delivery of viral vectors directly into the brain is a viable therapeutic strategy for long-term weight control in normal wild-type rats. A recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector encoding rat leptin (Ob) cDNA was generated (rAAV-betaOb). When administered once intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.), rAAV-betaOb suppressed the normal time-related weight gain for extended periods of time in adult Sprague-Dawley rats. The vector expression was confirmed by immunocytochemical localization of GFP and RT-PCR analysis of leptin in the hypothalamus. This sustained restraint on weight gain was not due to shifts in caloric consumption because food-intake was similar in rAAV-betaOb-treated and rAAV-GFP-treated control rats throughout the experiment. Weight gain suppression, first apparent after 2 weeks, was a result of reduced white fat depots and was accompanied by drastically reduced serum leptin and insulin concentrations in conjunction with normoglycemia. Additionally, there was a marked increase in uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) mRNA expression in brown adipose tissue, thereby indicating increased energy expenditure through thermogenesis. Seemingly, a selective enhancement in energy expenditure following central delivery of the leptin gene is a viable therapeutic strategy to control the age-related weight gain and provide protection from the accompanying multiple peripheral effects of hyperleptinemia and hyperinsulinemia.</ab>

<ab>Adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (AAV5) is under development for gene-therapy applications for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. To elucidate the structural features of AAV5 that control its enhanced transduction of the apical surface of airway epithelia compared with other AAV serotypes, X-ray crystallographic studies of the viral capsid have been initiated. The production, purification, crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of empty AAV5 viral capsids are reported. The crystals diffract X-rays to beyond 3.2 A resolution using synchrotron radiation and belong to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 264.7, b = 447.9, c = 629.7 A. There is one complete T = 1 viral capsid per asymmetric unit. The orientation and position of the viral capsid in the asymmetric unit have been determined by rotation and translation functions, respectively, and the AAV5 structure determination is in progress.</ab>

<ab>Gene therapy using recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors (rAAV) is generally considered safe. During the course of a study designed to determine the long-term efficacy of rAAV-mediated gene therapy initiated in newborn mice with the lysosomal storage disease, mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (MPSVII), a significant incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas and angiosarcomas was discovered. A hepatocellular carcinoma was first detected in a 35-week-old mouse and by 72 weeks of age, three out of five rAAV-treated MPSVII mice had similar lesions. These types of tumors had not been seen previously in long-term studies of MPSVII mice using recombinant enzyme or bone marrow transplantation. In an attempt to ascertain whether mouse strain or GUSB expression confers susceptibility to tumor formation, we histopathologically examined untreated normal mice of the same strain, untreated MPSVII mice, and normal mice overexpressing human GUSB for the presence of tumors and increased hepatocyte replication. The results of these studies do not indicate that MPSVII mice or mice overexpressing human GUSB are susceptible to tumor formation; however, the number of animals examined is too small to draw definitive conclusions. Results from quantitative PCR performed on the tumor samples suggest that the tumors are probably not caused by an insertional mutagenesis event followed by the clonal expansion of a transformed cell. In a separate study, a relatively large group of mice injected with varying doses and types of rAAV vectors had no evidence of hepatic or vascular tumors. Although the mechanism of tumor formation is currently unknown, the tumorigenic potential of rAAV vectors must be rigorously determined in long-term in vivo studies.</ab>

<ab>Gene therapy approaches for beta-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia focus on the transfer of a human beta-globin gene into the patient&amp;#39;s hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Expression of the transferred sequences should be erythroid specific and match the expression of the endogenous alpha-globin genes in adult erythropoiesis. Here we explore the potential of recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors for human beta-globin gene transfer. We have constructed a recombinant AAV-vector containing a human beta-globin gene together with the DNasel hypersensitive sites 4, 3 and 2 of the human beta-globin locus control region. The vector replicates to high titers and can efficiently transduce hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells. In transduced and G418 selected murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cell clones, human beta-globin gene expression was regulated and reached levels comparable to endogenous murine beta maj. These data show that AAV-vectors are promising tools in gene therapy approaches for the haemoglobinopathies.</ab>

<ab>Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has shown potential as a treatment for Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease. Recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors expressing the GDNF protein (rAAV-GDNF) have been used in rodent models of Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease to promote functional regeneration after 6-OHDA lesions of the nigrostriatal system. The goal of the present study was to assess the anatomical and functional efficacy of rAAV-GDNF in the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus). rAAV-GDNF was injected into the striatum and substantia nigra 4 weeks prior to a unilateral 6-OHDA lesion of the nigrostriatal bundle. Forty percent of the dopamine cells in the lesioned substantia nigra of the rAAV-GDNF-treated monkeys survived, compared with 21% in the untreated monkeys. Fine dopaminergic fibres were observed microscopically in the injected striatum of some rAAV-GDNF-treated monkeys, suggesting that rAAV-GDNF treatment may have prevented, at least in part, the loss of dopaminergic innervation of the striatum. Protection of dopamine cells and striatal fibre innervation was associated with amelioration of the lesion-induced behavioural deficits. rAAV-GDNF-treated monkeys showed partial or complete protection not only in the amphetamine and apomorphine rotation but also in head position and the parkinsonian disability rating scale. Therefore, our study provides evidence for the behavioural and anatomical efficacy of GDNF delivered via an rAAV vector as a possible treatment for Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease.</ab>

<ab>The therapeutic potential of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) for Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease is likely to depend on sustained delivery of the appropriate amount to the target areas. Recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (rAAVs) expressing GDNF may be a suitable delivery system for this purpose. The aim of this study was to define a sustained level of GDNF that does not affect the function of the normal dopamine (DA) neurons but does provide anatomical and behavioral protection against an intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion in the common marmoset. We found that unilateral intrastriatal injection of rAAV resulting in the expression of high levels of GDNF (14 ng/mg of tissue) in the striatum induced a substantial bilateral increase in tyrosine hydroxylase protein levels and activity as well as in DA turnover. Expression of low levels of GDNF (0.04 ng/mg of tissue), on the other hand, produced only minimal effects on DA synthesis and only on the injected side. In addition, the low level of GDNF provided approximately 85% protection of the nigral DA neurons and their projections to the striatum in the 6-OHDA-lesioned hemisphere. Furthermore, the anatomical protection was accompanied by a complete attenuation of sensorimotor neglect, head position bias, and amphetamine-induced rotation. We conclude that when delivered continuously, a low level of GDNF in the striatum (approximately threefold above baseline) is sufficient to provide optimal functional outcome.</ab>

<ab>Overexpression of human alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) using recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vectors provides a novel tool to study neurodegenerative processes seen in Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease and other synucleinopathies. We used a pseudotyped rAAV2/5 vector to express human wild-type (wt) alpha-syn, A53T mutated alpha-syn, or the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the primate ventral midbrain. Twenty-four adult common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were followed with regular behavioural tests for 1 year after transduction. alpha-Syn overexpression affected motor behaviour such that all animals remained asymptomatic for at least 9 weeks, then motor bias comprising head position bias and full body rotations were seen in wt-alpha-syn expressing animals between 15 and 27 weeks; in the later phase, the animals overexpressing the A53T alpha -syn, in particular, showed a gradual worsening of motor performance, with increased motor coordination errors. Histological analysis from animals overexpressing either the wt or A53T alpha -syn showed prominent degeneration of dopaminergic fibres in the striatum. In the ventral midbrain, however, the dopaminergic neurodegeneration was more prominent in the A53T group than in the WT group suggesting differential toxicity of these two proteins in the primate brain. The surviving cell bodies and their processes in the substantia nigra were stained by antibodies to the pathological form of alpha-syn that is phosphorylated at Ser position 129. Moreover, we found, for the first time, ubiquitin containing aggregates after overexpression of alpha-syn in the primate midbrain. There was also a variable loss of oligodendroglial cells in the cerebral peduncle. These histological and behavioural data suggest that this model provides unique opportunities to study progressive neurodegeneration in the dopaminergic system and deposition of alpha-syn and ubiquitin similar to that seen in Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease, and to test novel therapeutic targets for neuroprotective strategies.</ab>

<ab>We describe a general approach for achieving efficient and cell type-specific expression of exogenous genes in photoreceptor cells of the mammalian retina. Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors were used to transfer the bacterial lacZ gene or a synthetic green fluorescent protein gene (gfp) to mouse or rat retinas after injection into the subretinal space. Using a proximal murine rod opsin promoter (+86 to -385) to drive expression, reporter gene product was found exclusively in photoreceptors, not in any other retinal cell type or in the adjacent retinal pigment epithelium. GFP-expressing photoreceptors typically encompassed 10-20% of the total retinal area after a single 2-microl injection. Photoreceptors were transduced with nearly 100% efficiency in the region directly surrounding the injection site. We estimate approximately 2.5 million photoreceptors were transduced as a result of the single subretinal inoculation. This level of gene transfer and expression suggests the feasibility of genetic therapy for retinal disease. The gfp-containing rAAV stock was substantially free of both adenovirus and wild-type AAV, as judged by plaque assay and infectious center assay, respectively. Thus, highly purified, helper virus-free rAAV vectors can achieve high-frequency tissue-specific transduction of terminally differentiated, postmitotic photoreceptor cells.</ab>

<ab>The adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV) replication (Rep) proteins Rep78 and 68 (Rep78/68) exhibit a number of biochemical activities required for AAV replication, including specific binding to a 22-bp region of the terminal repeat, site-specific endonuclease activity, and helicase activity. Individual and clusters of charged amino acids were converted to alanines in an effort to generate a collection of conditionally defective Rep78/68 proteins. Rep78 variants were expressed in human 293 cells and analyzed for their ability to mediate replication of recombinant AAV vectors at various temperatures. The biochemical activities of Rep variants were further characterized in vitro by using Rep68 His-tagged proteins purified from bacteria. The results of these analyses identified a temperature-sensitive (ts) Rep protein (D40,42,44A-78) that exhibited a delayed replication phenotype at 32 degrees C, which exceeded wild-type activity by 48 h. Replication activity was reduced by more than threefold at 37 degrees C and was undetectable at 39 degrees C. Stability of the Rep78 protein paralleled replication levels at each temperature, further supporting a ts phenotype. Replication differences resulted in a 3-log-unit difference in virus yields between the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures (2.2 x 10(6) and 3 x 10(3), respectively), demonstrating that this is a relatively tight mutant. In addition to the ts Rep mutant, we identified a nonconditional mutant with a reduced ability to support viral replication in vivo. Additional characterization of this mutant demonstrated an Mg(2+)-dependent phenotype that was specific to Rep endonuclease activity and did not affect helicase activity. The two mutants described here are unique, in that Rep ts mutants have not previously been described and the D412A Rep mutant represents the first mutant in which the helicase and endonuclease functions can be distinguished biochemically. Further understanding of these mutants should facilitate our understanding of AAV replication and integration, as well as provide novel strategies for production of viral vectors.</ab>

<ab>Over the past decade, AAV-based vectors have emerged as promising candidates for gene therapeutic applications. Despite the broad tropism of the first eight serotypes identified, certain cell types are refractory to transduction with AAV-based vectors. Furthermore, for certain applications the targeting of specific cell types is desirable. To improve on present methods to alter AAV2 tropism, we take advantage of AAV2 mosaics. Here, we show that AAV2 mosaics have improved infectivity compared with all-mutant virions. Using an AAV2 mutant that contains the immunoglobulin-binding Z34C fragment of protein A, we demonstrate the utility of AAV2 mosaics to alter AAV2 tropism. This system allows us to transduce selectively and efficiently MO7e and Jurkat cells. The use of AAV2 mosaics with a protein A fragment inserted into their capsid, together with targeting antibodies, is a versatile method that allows the specific transduction of a wide array of cell types.</ab>

<ab>BACKGROUND: We have used wild-type and recombinant adeno-associated virus-2 (AAV) to study transduction, replication efficiencies, functional protein expression, and gene delivery to vascular cells in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Recombinant adeno-associated virus-2 (rAAV) plasmids (ranging in size to 110% of wild-type AAV) driven by 6 distinct promoters upstream of a beta-galactosidase cassette were effectively used for generation of replication-deficient virus, with titers consistently ranging from 2.5 x 10(5) IU/mL. AAV infectivity and replication in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were unrelated to cellular proliferative index establishing the potential utility of the virus for transduction of quiescent vascular cells. Long-term cultures of AAV-infected HUVEC established the presence of episomal forms at 18 days, although chromosome 19-specific integration was not evident. Functional beta-galactosidase activity approximately 400% above control was evident in HUVEC using either a murine collagen alpha 1(I) promoter (pTRCol alpha 1(I) beta) or CMV promoter (pTRCMV beta). RESULTS: Based on these initial data, in vivo studies were completed using a rat carotid artery model. Both wild-type AAV (titers -1X10(9) IU/mL) and rAAV (pTRCol alpha 1(I) beta or pTRCMV beta) efficiently infected vascular cells in vivo with endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell transduction frequencies approaching 90% as judged by DNA in situ polymerase chain reaction, with no evidence for disrupted vessel architecture. Protein expression using total vessel extracts at 48 hours postinfection demonstrated 20-fold increase in functional beta-galactosidase activity using pTRCol alpha 1(I) beta compared to saline-injected controls vessels (799 +/- 236 microU/mg protein vs 40.7 +/- 17 microU/mg protein). CONCLUSIONS: These data provide the first evidence that rAAV may be adapted for directed high-level transgene delivery and expression into normally quiescent vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells both in vitro and in vivo.</ab>

We used recombinant Adeno-associated virus (rAAV) to overexpress human wild-type (wt) alpha-syn and two human alpha-syn mutants with site-directed replacement of Ser-129 to alanine (S129A) or to aspartate (S129D) in the nigrostriatal tract of the rat to investigate the effect of Ser-129 phosphorylation state on dopaminergic neuron pathology. Rats were injected with rAAV2/5 vectors in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) on one side of the brain; the other side remained as a nontransduced control. The level of human wt or mutant alpha-syn expressed on the injected side was about four times the endogenous rat alpha-syn. There was a significant reduction of dopaminergic neurons in the SNc and dopamine (DA) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels in the striatum of all S129A-treated rats as early as 4 wk postinjection. Nigral DA pathology occurred more slowly in the wt-injected animals, but by 26 wk the wt alpha-syn group lost nigral TH neurons equivalent to the mutated S129A group at 8 wk. In stark contrast, we did not observe any pathological changes in S129D-treated animals. Therefore, the nonphosphorylated form of S129 exacerbates alpha-syn-induced nigral pathology, whereas Ser-129 phosphorylation eliminates alpha-syn-induced nigrostriatal degeneration. This suggests possible new therapeutic targets for Parkinson Disease.</ab>

<ab>We previously reported a double-stranded endonuclease from HeLa cells, endonuclease R (endo R), which specifically cleaves duplex DNA at sites rich in G.C base pairs. In this report we describe the purification of endo R to near homogeneity by conventional and affinity chromatography. The molecular mass of the active form of endo R is approximately 115-125 kDa. SDS-gel electrophoresis reveals a major protein species of 100 kDa. The enzyme requires Mg2+ as a cofactor and is equally active on closed circular and linear duplex DNA substrates that contain G-rich sequences. A 50% reduction in cleavage activity is observed with Ca2+ ions and no double-stranded cleavage occurs with Zn2+. Use of Mn2+ causes an altered specificity at low concentrations of enzyme or divalent metal ion and nonspecific degradation of the substrate at higher concentrations. Endo R is strongly inhibited by sodium or potassium chloride and exhibits a wide pH optimum of 6.0-9.0. The pI of the enzyme is between 6.5 and 7.0. A 2-fold stimulation is observed with the addition of dGTP or dATP but specific cleavage is inhibited by ATP at an equivalent concentration. Cleavage activity is competitively inhibited 10-fold more efficiently by single-stranded poly(dG)12 than by other DNA competitors. The ends of endo R cleavage products contain 5&amp;#39;-phosphate and 3&amp;#39;-hydroxyl groups, and a significant portion of these products were substrates for T4 DNA ligase. Endo R appears to be a previously uncharacterized mammalian endonuclease.</ab>

<ab>We examined the substrate specificity of endonuclease R (endo R) a mammalian endonuclease that cleaves G.C-rich DNA sequences. The best substrates for double-stranded cleavage were homopolymeric stretches of poly(dG).poly(dC). Plasmids which contain other G-rich sequences were also cleaved but at a reduced frequency. These included the telomeric sequences, d(G4T2) and d(G2-6A), which were cleaved at approximately one-third the frequency of d(G)n.d(C)n. The alternating copolymer d(GA) and the terminal sequences of adeno-associated virus d(G1-3T/A) were also cut. Poly(dA).poly(dT) and the alternating copolymer d(GC)n were not detectably cleaved. Although endo R has a nicking activity which converts supercoiled plasmids to nicked circular DNA, the nicking activity is random with respect to plasmid sequences. Specific cleavage of G-rich sequences appears to occur by a concerted double-stranded mechanism. The cleavage pattern within the G-rich runs suggests that cleavage can occur anywhere within the G-rich region. Product ligation experiments indicate that a limited number of cleavage events (1-2) occur/molecule. Inasmuch as the best substrates for endo R are d(G)n.d(C)n and telomeric sequences, we suggest that endo R may directly recognize and cleave DNA that contains G.G base pairing.</ab>

<ab>When circular recombinant plasmids containing adeno-associated virus (AAV) DNA sequences are transfected into human cells, the AAV provirus is rescued. Using these circular AAV plasmids as substrates, we isolated an enzyme fraction from HeLa cell nuclear extracts that excises intact AAV DNA in vitro from vector DNA and produces linear DNA products. The recognition signal for the enzyme is a polypurine-polypyrimidine sequence which is at least 9 residues long and rich in G.C base pairs. Such sequences are present in AAV recombinant plasmids as part of the first 15 base pairs of the AAV terminal repeat and in some cases as the result of cloning the AAV genome by G.C tailing. The isolated enzyme fraction does not have significant endonucleolytic activity on single-stranded or double-stranded DNA. Plasmid DNA that is transfected into tissue culture cells is cleaved in vivo to produce a pattern of DNA fragments similar to that seen with purified enzyme in vitro. The activity has been called endo R for rescue, and its behavior suggests that it may have a role in recombination of cellular chromosomes.</ab>

<k1>Phenotype</k1>
<ab>The adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) can package and deliver foreign DNA into cells for corrective gene delivery applications. The AAV serotypes have distinct cell binding, transduction, and antigenic characteristics that have been shown to be dictated by the capsid viral protein (VP) sequence. To understand the contribution of capsid structure to these properties, we have determined the crystal structure of AAV serotype 4 (AAV4), one of the most diverse serotypes with respect to capsid protein sequence and antigenic reactivity. Structural comparison of AAV4 to AAV2 shows conservation of the core beta strands (betaB to betaI) and helical (alphaA) secondary structure elements, which also exist in all other known parvovirus structures. However, surface loop variations (I to IX), some containing compensating structural insertions and deletions in adjacent regions, result in local topological differences on the capsid surface. These include AAV4 having a deeper twofold depression, wider and rounder protrusions surrounding the threefold axes, and a different topology at the top of the fivefold channel from that of AAV2. Also, the previously observed &amp;quot;valleys&amp;quot; between the threefold protrusions, containing AAV2&amp;#39;s heparin binding residues, are narrower in AAV4. The observed differences in loop topologies at subunit interfaces are consistent with the inability of AAV2 and AAV4 VPs to combine for mosaic capsid formation in efforts to engineer novel tropisms. Significantly, all of the surface loop variations are associated with amino acids reported to affect receptor recognition, transduction, and anticapsid antibody reactivity for AAV2. This observation suggests that these capsid regions may also play similar roles in the other AAV serotypes.</ab>

<ab>OBJECTIVE: To determine the foci and duration of protein expression following virus-mediated gene transfer to the optic nerve. METHODS: A cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter was linked to a lacZ-SV40 polyA reporter gene or a humanized green fluorescent protein (hgfp) reporter gene, then inserted into a bacterial plasmid containing adeno-associated virus (AAV) terminal repeat sequences. The CMV-lacZ or the CMV-hgfp construct were injected into the vitreous cavity of strain-13 guinea pigs. Controls consisted of eyes injected with AAV without the promoter and reporter elements or eyes that received no injections. The eyes and optic nerves were processed for beta-galactosidase immunohistochemistry and hgfp fluorescence analyses. Cellular transduction at the messenger RNA (mRNA) level was evaluated by in situ reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Weekly fundus photography, done for 1 month, documented the absence of any ocular abnormality due to the viral injections. No in vivo hgfp fluorescence of the retina was visualized. Beta-galactosidase histochemical analysis of eye cups that received the lacZ gene construct showed blue lacZ staining of the optic nerve head at 2 weeks. Light microscopy revealed the blue beta-galactosidase reaction product in fibers, glial cells, and blood vessels of the optic nerve head and retrobulbar nerve. Histochemistry showed absence of beta-galactosidase in the optic nerve at 3 to 12 months, but immunochemistry showed the persistence of beta-galactosidase in fibers, glial cells, and blood vessels as late as 1 year after a single ocular injection. In the retina, histochemical staining showed evidence of lacZ at 3 months, but not later. In situ reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed brown lacZ mRNA reaction product in ganglion cells of the retina. Control eyes that received AAV without the promoter and reporter elements and the eyes that received no viral injections and were processed for beta-galactosidase showed no reporter gene expression in any ocular tissue or cell type. CONCLUSIONS: Viral-mediated gene transfer can be successfully accomplished in the optic nerve. Further evaluation is needed to determine whether the level of protein expression at 1 year after injection, which is clearly reduced relative to shorter postinjection time, is sufficient for therapeutic purposes. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: We have previously shown that gene therapy with catalase suppressed experimental optic neuritis at 1 month after injection. Viral-mediated gene transfer may be a powerful technique for the treatment of optic neuropathies, particularly for recurrences of optic neuritis, if long-term expression of transduced protein can be demonstrated in the optic nerve.</ab>

<ab>We constructed insertion and deletion mutants with mutations within the adeno-associated virus (AAV) sequences of the infectious recombinant plasmid pSM620. Studies of these mutants revealed at least three AAV phenotypes. Mutants with mutations between 11 and 42 map units were partially or completely defective for rescue and replication of the AAV sequences from the recombinant plasmids (rep mutants). The mutants could be complemented by mutants with replication-positive phenotypes. The protein(s) that is affected in rep mutants has not been identified, but the existence of the rep mutants proves that at least one AAV-coded protein is required for viral DNA replication. Also, the fact that one of the rep mutant mutations maps within the AAV intron suggests that the intron sequences code for part of a functional AAV protein. Mutants with mutations between 63 and 91 map units synthesized normal amounts of AAV duplex DNA but could not generate single-stranded virion DNA (cap mutants). The cap phenotype could be complemented by rep mutants and is probably due to a defect in the major AAV capsid protein, VP3. This suggests that a preformed capsid or precursor is required for the accumulation of single-stranded AAV progeny DNA. Mutants with mutations between 48 and 55 map units synthesized normal amounts of AAV single-stranded and duplex DNA but produced substantially lower yields of infectious virus particles than wild-type AAV (lip mutants). The lip phenotype is probably due to a defect in the minor capsid protein, VPI, and suggests the existence of an additional (as yet undiscovered) AAV mRNA. Evidence is also presented for recombination between mutant AAV genomes during lytic growth.</ab>

<ab>Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a human DNA virus that has a broad host range and can be grown both as an integrated provirus and as a lytic genome. These properties suggested that AAV may be useful as a mammalian transduction vector. To test this possibility, we have isolated a recombinant AAV viral stock in which the neomycin resistance gene was substituted for the AAV capsid genes. Using this recombinant stock, we have demonstrated that AAV can be used to transduce foreign DNA into human and murine tissue culture cells. In addition, we have demonstrated that, if the transductants are superinfected with a helper virus (adenovirus), the recombinant AAV genome is rescued from the proviral state and amplified to high copy number. These unique features of AAV vectors suggest that they may have a broad utility in the study of biological problems. Because AAV, itself, is nonpathogenic in both humans and animals, these vectors also may be useful for the purpose of gene therapy.</ab>

<ab>We have used differential cell extraction and conventional chromatography to separate and partially purify the four adeno-associated virus (AAV) nonstructural proteins Rep78, Rep68, Rep52, and Rep40. In the cytoplasmic extracts Rep52 and Rep40 were present in greater abundance than Rep68 and Rep78, with Rep78 being the least abundant. In nuclear extracts the four Rep proteins were approximately equal in abundance. Regardless of the subcellular fraction examined, three of the Rep proteins (Rep78, Rep68, and Rep40) consisted of two protein species with slightly different mobilities during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In contrast, Rep52 consisted of only one protein species. Both Rep78 and Rep68 were capable of binding efficiently to AAV terminal hairpin DNA substrates, but we could not detect site-specific DNA binding by Rep52 and Rep40. Like Rep68, Rep78 had both an ATP-dependent trs endonuclease and a DNA helicase activity. Both Rep78 and Rep68 cut the terminal AAV sequence at the same site (nucleotide 124). The binding, trs endonuclease, and DNA helicase activities comigrated during sucrose density gradient centrifugation with a mobility expected for a monomer of the protein, suggesting that the three biochemical activities were intrinsic properties of the larger Rep proteins. The chromatographic behavior and the DNA-binding properties of the four Rep proteins identified at least two domains within the rep coding region, an exposed hydrophobic domain within the C-terminal end (amino acids 578 to 621) and a region within the N terminus (amino acids 1 to 214) which was necessary for binding to the terminal repeat sequence. No site-specific nuclease activity was seen in the presence of nucleotide analogs ATP-gamma-S or AMP-PNP, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis was required for the endonuclease reaction. Furthermore, although ATP was the only cofactor which would support the trs endonuclease activity of Rep78, Rep68 nuclease activity was seen in the presence of several other nucleotide cofactors, including CTP, GTP, and UTP.</ab>

<ab>Genetic studies of adeno-associated virus (AAV) indicate that two AAV genes are required for viral DNA replication: the palindromic terminal repeat, which is the origin for DNA replication, and the rep gene, which codes for a family of at least four viral nonstructural proteins. To determine the biochemical function of the Rep proteins, we have purified the AAV Rep68 protein to apparent homogeneity. We find that it contains a site-specific and strand-specific endonuclease activity that specifically cuts the AAV origin at the terminal resolution site (TRS). The TRS endonuclease requires the presence of ATP for activity and becomes covalently attached to the 5&amp;#39; end at the cut site. In addition to the specific endonuclease activity, Rep68 also contains a DNA helicase activity. These results demonstrate that the large AAV Rep proteins have a direct role in AAV DNA replication; namely, they provide the activities required for the resolution of covalently joined AAV termini.</ab>

<ab>We have identified and characterized a DNA-protein complex that forms with the adeno-associated virus (AAV) terminal repeats. The complex formed only if the terminal palindrome was in the covalently closed or hairpin configuration; little if any binding was detected with the open duplex form of the terminal repeat. This fact suggested that both secondary structure and primary sequence are essential elements of recognition. DNase I protection studies indicated that virtually all of the A-A&amp;#39; palindrome and significant portions of the B-B&amp;#39; and C-C&amp;#39; palindromes are protected. The postulated terminal resolution site of AAV also is protected. Restriction mapping of the sequences necessary for binding indicated that almost all of the terminal palindrome must be present for binding to occur. Hairpins which are similar in size and shape to the AAV termini did not exhibit competition for binding, and the complex formed only if AAV-infected extracts were used. Thus, the binding reaction is specific for AAV sequences. The viral-coded nonstructural proteins Rep78 and Rep68 comigrated with the DNA-protein complex on neutral acrylamide gels, suggesting that one or both of these proteins are components of the complex. The characteristics of the complex suggested that it has a role in AAV DNA replication.</ab>

<ab>We used a high-titer recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector to express WT or mutant human alpha-synuclein in the substantia nigra of adult marmosets. The alpha-synuclein protein was expressed in 90-95% of all nigral dopamine neurons and distributed by anterograde transport throughout their axonal and dendritic projections. The transduced neurons developed severe neuronal pathology, including alpha-synuclein-positive cytoplasmic inclusions and granular deposits; swollen, dystrophic, and fragmented neuritis; and shrunken and pyknotic, densely alpha-synuclein-positive perikarya. By 16 wk posttransduction, 30-60% of the tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons were lost, and the tyrosine hydroxylase-positive innervation of the caudate nucleus and putamen was reduced to a similar extent. The rAAV-alpha-synuclein-treated monkeys developed a type of motor impairment, i.e., head position bias, compatible with this magnitude of nigrostriatal damage. rAAV vector-mediated alpha-synuclein gene transfer provides a transgenic primate model of nigrostriatal alpha-synucleinopathy that is of particular interest because it develops slowly over time, like human Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease (PD), and expresses neuropathological features (alpha-synuclein-positive inclusions and dystrophic neurites, in particular) that are similar to those seen in idiopathic PD. This model offers new opportunities for the study of pathogenetic mechanisms and exploration of new therapeutic targets of particular relevance to human PD.</ab>

<ab>Intrastriatal delivery of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene by viral vectors is being explored as a tool for local delivery of L-dopa in animals with lesions of the nigrostriatal pathway. The functional effects reported using this approach have been disappointing, probably because the striatal L-dopa levels attained have been too low. In the present study, we have defined a critical threshold level of L-dopa, 1.5 pmol/mg of tissue, that has to be reached to induce any significant functional effects. Using new generation high-titer recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors, we show that levels of striatal L-dopa production exceeding this threshold can be obtained provided that tyrosine hydroxylase is coexpressed with the cofactor synthetic enzyme, GTP-cyclohydrolase-1. After striatal transduction with this combination of vectors, substantial functional improvement in both drug-induced and spontaneous behavior was observed in rats with either complete or partial 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the nigrostriatal pathway. However, complete reversal of motor deficits occurred only in animals in which part of the striatal dopamine innervation was left intact. Spared nigrostriatal fibers thus may convert L-dopa to dopamine and store and release dopamine in a more physiologically relevant manner in the denervated striatum to mediate better striatal output-dependent motor function. We conclude that intrastriatal L-dopa delivery may be a viable strategy for treatment and control of adverse side effects associated with oral L-dopa therapy such as on-off fluctuations and drug-induced dyskinesias in patients with Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease.</ab>

<ab>Recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors display efficient tropism for transduction of the dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra. Taking advantage of this unique property of recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors, we expressed wild-type and A53T mutated human alpha-synuclein in the nigrostriatal dopamine neurons of adult rats for up to 6 months. Cellular and axonal pathology, including alpha-synuclein-positive cytoplasmic inclusions and swollen, dystrophic neurites similar to those seen in brains from patients with Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease, developed progressively over time. These pathological alterations occurred preferentially in the nigral dopamine neurons and were not observed in other nondopaminergic neurons transduced by the same vectors. The degenerative changes were accompanied by a loss of 30-80% of the nigral dopamine neurons, a 40-50% reduction of striatal dopamine, and tyrosine hydroxylase levels that was fully developed by 8 weeks. Significant motor impairment developed in those animals in which dopamine neuron cell loss exceeded a critical threshold of 50-60%. At 6 months, signs of cell body and axonal pathology had subsided, suggesting that the surviving neurons had recovered from the initial insult, despite the fact that alpha-synuclein expression was maintained at a high level. These results show that nigral dopamine neurons are selectively vulnerable to high levels of either wild-type or mutant alpha-synuclein, pointing to a key role for alpha-synuclein in the pathogenesis of Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease. Targeted overexpression of alpha-synuclein in the nigrostriatal system may provide a new animal model of Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease that reproduces some of the cardinal pathological, neurochemical, and behavioral features of the human disease.</ab>

<ab>Administration of nerve growth factor (NGF) by intracerebroventricular infusion or transplantation of NGF-secreting cells to the basal forebrain improves spatial memory in aged animals. Using the adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector system, basal forebrain neurons were transduced to produce NGF ectopically for long intervals (at least 9 months). Rats received intraseptal injections of either the control vector, pTR-UF4, or the pTR-NGFmyc at 3 months of age, prior to testing their performance in the Morris water task. An age-related decrease in the acquisition of the hidden platform location was found at 12 months of age in the pTR-UF4 control group, but not in the pTR-NGFmyc group. Further, when compared to 3 month old untreated animals, the control group, but not the pTR-NGFmyc group, was impaired at 12 months of age. Concomitant to preventing age-related memory deficits, the NGF gene transfer increased cholinergic neuron size by 34% in the medial septum. This approach may therefore represent a viable therapy for age-related dementia involving dysfunction in cholinergic activity and memory, such as Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease.</ab>

<ab>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was expressed via injection of viral vector into the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) to investigate its influence on nigrostriatal dopaminergic activity and locomotor behavior. The recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector, pTR-BDNFmyc, incorporated the neuron-specific enolase (NSE) promoter and the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element driving expression of both epitope-tagged BDNF and green fluorescent protein (GFP) bicistronically. The control vector, pTR-UF4, incorporated NSE promoter-driven GFP expression only. Transgene expression persisted in both vector groups throughout the 9 month course of the study. Partial 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions were conducted in the SNc ipsilateral to, and 6 months after, transduction with either the pTR-BDNFmyc or the pTR-UF4. Transgenic BDNFmyc had no effect on the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-labeled neurons in the SNc after 6-OHDA-lesions, but did block the amphetamine-induced, ipsiversive, turning-behavior caused by the lesion in the pTR-UF4 group. The BDNFmyc-transduced group also demonstrated more locomotor activity and rotational activity contralateral to the lesioned side than did the pTR-UF4-transduced group. Long-term, stable expression of BDNF can therefore modulate locomotor activity without significantly affecting nigrostriatal dopaminergic survival.</ab>

<ab>The expression of GAP-43 was modulated genetically in the adult rat nigrostriatal or septohippocampal pathway using recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors incorporating the neuron specific enolase (NSE) promoter and either a rat GAP-43 cDNA or the corresponding antisense sequence. Bicistronic expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) enabled us to evaluate transduced neurons selectively. Single injections of rAAV into the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) transduced both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neurons stably for the 3-month duration of the study. Transduction with the GAP-43 vector in this region: (1) increased GAP-43 mRNA levels 2-fold compared to controls; (2) led to GAP-43 immunoreactivity in neuronal perikarya, axons, and dendrites that was not observed otherwise; and (3) resulted in GAP-43/ GFP-positive axons that were traced to the striatum where they formed clusters of aberrant nets. The GAP-43 antisense vector, in contrast, decreased neuropil GAP-43 immunoreactivity compared to controls in the SNc. In septum, injections of the GAP-43 expressing vector also caused aberrant clusters of GAP-43 labelled fibers in terminal fields, i.e., fornix and hippocampus, that were not observed in control tissues. It therefore appears that rAAV vectors provide a novel approach for modulating intraneuronal GAP-43 expression in the adult brain.</ab>

<ab>Viral vector-mediated gene transfer in brain can provide a means for gene therapy and functional studies. However, robust and persistent transgene expression in specific populations of the adult brain has been difficult to achieve. In an attempt to produce localized and persistent transduction in rat brain, we compared recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors incorporating either the immediate early cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter or the neuron-specific enolase (NSE) promoter. Transduction in hippocampus resulting from the NSE promoter-containing construct was more efficient and persistent than that resulting from the CMV promoter-containing construct. Most hippocampal cells transduced with the NSE promoter had multipolar neuron morphology. Neurons with glutamatergic morphology were transduced weakly. In order to produce a local supply of neurotrophic factor to cells that degenerate under certain disease and experimental conditions, the NSE promoter was utilized to drive expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in medial septum or substantia nigra. In this construct, the NSE promoter drives dicistronic expression of BDNF and an enhanced version of green fluorescent protein (GFP). We estimated 3000-15,000 GFP-positive cells per injection of rAAV into septum or substantia nigra, a transduction ratio of 5-20 infectious virus particles per transduced cell. This frequency may be sufficient for trophic factor gene therapy as well as for investigating specific protein function in &amp;quot;topical (i.e., localized) transgenic&amp;quot; animals produced by rAAV.</ab>

<ab>Trophic factor gene therapy may provide a rational treatment strategy for neurodegenerative disease. Recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors, incorporating a neuron-specific promoter driving bicistronic expression of green fluorescent protein and either nerve growth factor or brain-derived neurotrophic factor, transduced 10,000-15,000 neurons in the medial septum for periods of at least six months. Both cholinergic and non-cholinergic neurons expressed green fluorescent protein. Nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor vectors produced up to 50% increases in immunohistochemical detection of the acetylcholine-synthesizing enzyme in septal neurons ipsilateral to the injection. Increased levels of this enzyme, choline acetyltransferase, persisted for six months with the brain-derived neurotrophic factor vector. The nerve growth factor vector increased Trk receptor immunoreactivity in a volume of brain exceeding that of the transduced cells. Counterstaining for the neuronal marker, NeuN, or Nissl substance did not reveal any vector toxicity at any time-point. It therefore appears that the lasting effects of vector-mediated trophic factor gene transfer will offer a new approach for modulating septal cholinergic transmission and Trk receptor activity.</ab>

<ab>Scalable production of rAAV vectors remains a major obstacle to the clinical application of this prototypical gene therapy vector. A recently developed baculovirus-based production protocol (M. Urabe et al., 2002, Hum. Gene Ther. 13, 1935-1943) found limited applications due to the system&amp;#39;s design. Here we report a detailed analysis of the stability of the original baculovirus system components BacRep, BacVP, and transgene cassette-containing BacGFP. All of the baculovirus helpers analyzed were prone to passage-dependent loss-of-function deletions resulting in considerable decreases in rAAV titers. To alleviate the instability and to extend the baculovirus platform to other rAAV serotypes, we have modified both Rep- and Cap-encoding components of the original system. The modifications include a parvoviral phospholipase A2 domain swap allowing production of infectious rAAV8 vectors in vivo. Alternatively, an infectious rAAV8 (or rAAV5) vector incorporating the AAV2 VP1 capsid protein in a mosaic vector particle with AAV8 capsid proteins was produced using a novel baculovirus vector. In this vector, the level of AAV2 VP1 expression is controlled with a &amp;quot;riboswitch,&amp;quot; a self-cleaving ribozyme controlled by toyocamycin in the &amp;quot;ON&amp;quot; mode. The redesigned baculovirus system improves our capacity for rAAV manufacturing by making this production platform more applicable to other existing serotypes.</ab>

<ab>Cellular sequences flanking integrated copies of the adeno-associated virus (AAV) genome were isolated from a latently infected clonal human cell line and used to probe genomic blots derived from an additional 21 independently derived clones of human cells latently infected with AAV. In genomic blots of uninfected human cell lines and of primary human tissue, each flanking-sequence probe hybridized to unique bands, but in 15 of the 22 latently infected clones the flanking sequences hybridized not only to the original fragments but also to a total of 36 additional species. AAV probes also hybridized to 22 of these new bands, representing 11 of the 15 positive clones, but never to the fragment characteristic of uninfected cell DNA. From these data we conclude that the AAV genome preferentially integrates into a specific region of the cellular genome. We have determined that the integration site is unique to chromosome 19 by somatic cell hybrid mapping, and this sequence has been isolated from uninfected human DNA.</ab>

<ab>During adeno-associated virus (AAV) type 2 productive infections, the p19 promoter of AAV is activated by the AAV Rep78 and Rep68 proteins. Rep-induced activation of p19 depends on the presence of one of several redundant Rep binding elements (RBEs) within the p5 promoter or within the terminal repeats (TR). In the absence of the TR, the p5 RBE and the p19 Sp1 site at position -50 are essential for p19 transactivation. To determine how a Rep complex bound at p5 induces transcription at p19, we made a series of p19 promoter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs in which the p5 RBE was inserted at different locations upstream or downstream of the p19 mRNA start site. The RBE acted like a repressor element at most positions in the presence of both Rep and adenovirus (Ad), and the level of repression increased dramatically as the RBE was inserted closer to the p19 promoter. We concluded that the RBE by itself was not a conventional upstream activation signal and instead behaved like a repressor. To understand how the Rep-RBE complex within p5 activated p19, we considered the possibility that its role was to function as an architectural protein whose purpose was to bring other p5 transcriptional elements to the p19 promoter. In order to address this possibility, we replaced both the p5 RBE and the p19 Sp1 site with GAL4 binding sites. The modified GAL4-containing constructs were cotransfected with plasmids that expressed GAL4 fusion proteins capable of interacting through p53 and T-antigen (T-ag) protein domains. In the presence of Ad and the GAL4 fusion proteins, the p19 promoter exhibited strong transcriptional activation that was dependent on both the GAL4 fusion proteins and Ad infection. This suggested that the primary role of the p5 RBE and the p19 Sp1 sites was to act as a scaffold for bringing transcription complexes in the p5 promoter into close proximity with the p19 promoter. Since Rep and Sp1 themselves were not essential for transactivation, we tested mutants within the other p5 transcriptional elements in the context of GAL4-induced looping to determine which of the other p5 elements was necessary for p19 induction. Mutation of the p5 major late-transcription factor site reduced p19 activity but did not eliminate induction in the presence of the GAL4 fusion proteins. However, mutation of the p5 YY1 site at position -60 (YY1-60) eliminated GAL4-induced transactivation. This implicated the YY1-60 protein complexes in p19 induction by Rep. In addition, both basal p19 activity and activity in the presence of Ad increased when the YY1-60 site was mutated even in the absence of Rep or GAL4 fusion proteins. Therefore, there are likely to be alternative p5-p19 interactions that are Rep independent in which the YY1-60 complex inhibits p19 transcription. We concluded that transcriptional control of the p19 promoter was dependent on the formation of complexes between the p5 and p19 promoters and that activation of the p19 promoter depends largely on the ability of Rep and Sp1 to form a scaffold that positions the p5 YY1 complex near the p19 promoter.</ab>

<ab>Adeno-associated virus (AAV) integrated transgene expression within guinea pig cochlea has been previously documented. This article extends these studies by characterizing the AAV-mediated gene transfer for duration of transgene expression within the cochlea and its effect upon cochlear cytoarchitecture over a period of 6 months. All animals infused with AAV expressed the transgene product, bacterial beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) enzyme, in the spiral limbus, spiral ligament, spiral ganglion cells and the organ of Corti at 2-24 weeks after infusion. However, the level of beta-gal expression, as determined from intensity of immunoreactivity, was relatively lower at 24 weeks as compared with 2 weeks. The cellular and tissue architecture within the AAV-beta-gal perfused cochleae, harvested 2-8 weeks after AAV infusion, was generally intact, ie free from inflammation and cellular degeneration. However, cellular degeneration and degradation was apparent in the cochleae of some but not all animals harvested at 12 and 24 weeks after AAV infusion.</ab>

<ab>This study examined the &amp;#39;humanized, red-shifted&amp;#39; version of the jellyfish Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (hrGFP) as a novel reporter for in vivo gene transfer studies in the cochlea using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. Approximately 10(5) AAV vectors containing the hrGFP reporter gene were infused over 2 days or 1 week into the cochlea of the guinea pig via an osmotic minipump. Saline infused, non-infused, as well as AAV-beta-galactosidase infused guinea pigs served as the negative controls. The hrGFP transgene expression was detected as moderate intensity fluorescence easily distinguished from the background. Increased fluorescence was seen in the spiral ganglion, spiral ligament, spiral limbus, organ of Corti, and Reissner&amp;#39;s membrane of the AAV-hrGFP infused animals. Control animals showed minimal fluorescence throughout the cochlea. Comparison of the 2 day and 1 week AAV-hrGFP infused animals showed qualitatively increased fluorescence in the 2 day animals. Background autofluorescence in the stria vascularis was noted in both the experimental and the control animals. In addition, fluorescence was detected in the contralateral cochlea of the AAV-hrGFP infused animals. Subsequent PCR analysis confirmed the presence of viral particles in the AAV-hrGFP infused cochlea as well as in the brain and the contralateral cochlea. This finding has important implications for the eventual implementation of cochlear gene therapy. The results not only reinforce the need to assess the introduction and expression of foreign genes in the target cochlea but also consider issues of viral spread, safety, and modes of gene delivery. This study establishes hrGFP as an effective reporter of gene transfer and transgene expression in the cochlea. GFP&amp;#39;s small gene size, stability, ease of detection, and potential for diverse biological applications will be invaluable for a variety of future gene transfer and expression studies in the cochlea.</ab>

<ab>HYPOTHESIS: Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a suitable viral vector for transgene expression within the mammalian vestibular organs. BACKGROUND: In vivo introduction and expression of a foreign gene within the cochlear tissues have been established using a variety of viral vectors and guinea pig as the animal model. However, the vestibular neuroepithelia of the mammalian inner ear as a potential target for transgene expression remain to be investigated. METHODS: Transgene expression was assessed within the vestibular neuroepithelia of guinea pigs after intracochlear infusion of the recombinant AAV vector with the aid of an osmotic minipump. Evaluation of the transgene within the vestibular apparatus focused on its duration of expression from 2-24 weeks after intracochlear AAV infusion using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: In the AAV-beta-galactosidase (beta-gal)-infused animals, the sensory hair cells as well as the supporting epithelial cells of cristae and maculae were positive for the transgene expression. The relative level of beta-gal expression was noted to decrease progressively over time. Transduction of the vestibular neuroepithelia also was observed in the contralateral ear, a finding that has been documented previously in AAV-integrated transgene expression in the cochlea. CONCLUSION: This study reports the first demonstration of introduction and long-term transgene expression within the vestibular neuroepithelia. The ability to express a foreign gene with the vestibular system allows the possibility of experimental and therapeutic application of gene therapy technology to address vestibular function and dysfunction.</ab>

<ab>Gene therapy is currently being used to treat many disorders including cancer, viral infection and the degenerative and fatal diseases of the cardiovascular and the central nervous systems. However, the potential use of gene therapy for alleviation of hearing impairment has not been investigated despite the absence of effective therapy for most forms of inherited hearing disorders. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of introducing genetic material directly into the peripheral auditory system using adeno-associated virus (AAV) as the transfection vector and Hartley guinea pigs as the animal model. Approximately 10(5) particles of AAV containing the bacterial beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) sequence with Ad 2 major late promoter were infused into the cochlea of the animal with the aid of an osmotic minipump. Animals were killed after 2 weeks. Two Hartley guinea pigs with intracochlear saline infusion and four unoperated (nonperfused) animals served as negative controls. Both, the infused and the contralateral, non-infused cochleae were harvested from each animal, decalcified, and embedded in paraffin. Sections, 8 microns in width, were cut from the embedded cochleae and assayed for beta-gal expression via immunohistochemistry. Animals perfused with AAV showed intense immunohistochemical reactivity in the spiral limbus, spiral ligament, spiral ganglion cells and the organ of Corti in the perfused cochlea and a much weaker staining but with similar pattern in the contralateral ear. Cochleae from saline-infused and unoperated animals were devoid of the DAB stain. This study demonstrates for the first time in vivo expression of a foreign gene within the mammalian inner ear resulting from its localized, AAV-mediated introduction. The ability to introduce and stably express exogenous genetic material in the peripheral auditory system will have both experimental and therapeutic benefits. These results lay the groundwork for future studies assessing the potential use of gene therapy for alleviation of hearing impairment.</ab>

<ab>Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are actively being developed for clinical gene-therapy applications and the efficiencies of the vectors could be significantly improved by a detailed understanding of their viral capsid structures and the structural determinants of their tissue-transduction interactions. AAV8 is approximately 80% identical to the more widely studied AAV2, but its liver-transduction efficiency is significantly greater than that of AAV2 and other serotypes. The production, purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic analysis of AAV8 viral capsids are reported. The crystals diffract X-rays to 3.0 A resolution using synchrotron radiation and belong to the hexagonal space group P6(3)22, with unit-cell parameters a = 257.5, c = 443.5 A. The unit cell contains two viral particles, with ten capsid viral protein monomers per crystallographic asymmetric unit.</ab>

<ab>In mammals, including humans, the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle and the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus contain neural stem cells, which continue to proliferate even in adulthood and give rise to new neurons. Neurogenesis in these areas is enhanced by brain insults. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promotes neuronal survival and differentiation during the development of the nervous system. In the adult intact brain, BDNF administration in the lateral ventricle or ventricular zone stimulates neurogenesis in several forebrain areas. Here we show that intrahippocampal transduction of recombinant adeno-associated virus carrying the BDNF gene giving rise to levels of BDNF protein sufficient to induce a functional response inhibits the formation of new dentate granule cells triggered by global forebrain ischemia in rats. Our data indicate that long-term delivery of a neurotrophic factor, which is considered as a novel neuroprotective strategy for human brain diseases, may attenuate intrinsic neuroregenerative responses.</ab>

<ab>Adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV2) uses heparan sulfate proteoglycan as a cell surface-attachment receptor. In this study the structures of AAV2 alone and complexed with heparin were determined to approximately 18A resolution using cryo-electron microscopy and three-dimensional image reconstruction. A difference map showed positive density, modeled as heparin, close to the icosahedral twofold axes and between the protrusions that surround the threefold axes of the capsid. Regions of the model near the threefold place the receptor in close proximity to basic residues previously identified as part of the heparin binding site. The region of the model near the twofold axes identifies a second contact site, not previously characterized but which is also possibly configured by heparin binding. The difference map also revealed two significant conformational changes: (I) at the tops of the threefold protrusions, which have become flattened in the complex, and (II) at the fivefold axes where the top of the channel is widened possibly in response to movement of the HI loops in the capsid proteins. Ordered density in the interior of the capsid in the AAV2-heparin complex was interpreted as nucleic acid, consistent with the presence of non-viral DNA in the expressed capsids.</ab>

<ab>Interaction between the adenoassociated virus (AAV) replication proteins, Rep68 and 78, and the viral terminal repeats (TRs) is mediated by a DNA sequence termed the Rep-binding element (RBE). This element is necessary for Rep-mediated unwinding of duplex DNA substrates, directs Rep catalyzed cleavage of the AAV origin of DNA replication, and is required for viral transcription and proviral integration. Six discrete Rep complexes with the AAV TR substrates have been observed in vitro, and cross-linking studies suggest these complexes contain one to six molecules of Rep. However, the functional relationship between Rep oligomerization and biochemical activity is unclear. Here we have characterized Rep complexes that form on the AAV TR. Both Rep68 and Rep78 appear to form the same six complexes with the AAV TR, and ATP seems to stimulate formation of specific, higher order complexes. When the sizes of these Rep complexes were estimated on native polyacrylamide gels, the four slower migrating complexes were larger than predicted by an amount equivalent to one or two TRs. To resolve this discrepancy, the molar ratio of protein and DNA was calculated for the three largest complexes. Data from these experiments indicated that the larger complexes included multiple TRs in addition to multiple Rep molecules and that the Rep-to-TR ratio was approximately 2. The two largest complexes were also associated with increased Rep-mediated, origin cleavage activity. Finally, we characterized a second, Rep-mediated cleavage event that occurs adjacent to the normal nicking site, but on the opposite strand. This second site nicking event effectively results in double-stranded DNA cleavage at the normal nicking site.</ab>

<ab>Human pancreatic islet cells and hepatocytes represent the two most likely target cells for genetic therapy of type I diabetes. However, limits to the efficiency of rAAV serotype 2 (rAAV2)-mediated gene transfer have been reported for both of these cell targets. Here we report that nonserotype 2 AAV capsids can mediate more efficient transduction of islet cells, with AAV1 being the most efficient serotype in murine islets, suggesting that receptor abundance could be limiting. In order to test this, we generated rAAV particles that display a ligand (ApoE) that targets the low-density lipoprotein receptor, which is present on both of these cell types. The rAAV/ApoE viruses greatly enhanced the efficiency of transduction of both islet cells ex vivo and murine hepatocytes in vivo when compared to native rAAV2 serotype (220- and four-fold, respectively). The use of receptor-targeted rAAV particles may circumvent the lower abundance of receptors on certain nonpermissive cell types.</ab>

<ab>We have applied fluorescence anisotropy and molecular beacon fluorescence methods to study the interactions between the Adeno-associated virus Rep78/Rep68 protein and the 23-bp Rep binding element (RBE). Rep78/Rep68 stably interacted with both the single- and double-stranded conformations of the RBE, but the interaction mechanisms of single- and double-stranded DNA appeared to be fundamentally different. The stoichiometry of Rep78 association with both the separate top and bottom strands of the RBE was 1:1, and the relative dissociation constant (K(D)) values of these associations were calculated to be 2.3x10(-8) and 3.2x10(-8) M, respectively. In contrast, the stoichiometry of Rep78 association with the double-stranded RBE was 2:1, and the dissociation constant was determined to be 4.2x10(-15) M(2). Moreover, Rep78/Rep68 interaction with the 23-bp duplex RBE appeared to cause localized melting of the double-stranded DNA substrate in the absence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This melting activity showed slower kinetics than binding and may contribute to the initiation of ATP-dependent Rep78 helicase activity.</ab>

<ab>Intraventricular administration of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in primate and humans to study Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease (PD) has revealed the potential for GDNF to induce weight loss. Our previous data indicate that bilateral continuous hypothalamic GDNF overexpression via recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) results in significant failure to gain weight in young rats and weight loss in aged rats. Based on these previous results, we hypothesized that because the nigrostriatal tract passes through the lateral hypothalamus, motor hyperactivity mediated by nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) may have been responsible for the previously observed effect on body weight. In this study, we compared bilateral injections of rAAV2/5-GDNF in hypothalamus versus substantia nigra (SN) in aged Brown-Norway X Fisher 344 rats. Nigrostriatal GDNF overexpression resulted in significantly greater weight loss than rats treated in hypothalamus. The nigral or hypothalamic GDNF-induced weight loss was unrelated to motor activity levels of the rats, though some of the weight loss could be attributed to a transient reduction in food intake. Forebrain DA levels did not account for the observed effects on body weight, although GDNF-induced increases in nucleus accumbens DA may have partially contributed to this effect in the hypothalamic GDNF-treated group. However, only nigrostriatal GDNF overexpression induced activation of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) in a small population of corticotrophin-releasing factor [corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH)] neurons located specifically in the medial parvocellullar division (MPD) of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Activation of these hypothalamic CRH neurons likely accounted for the observed metabolic effects leading to weight loss in obese rats.</ab>

<ab>Canavan disease (CD) is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy caused by deficiency of aspartoacylase (ASPA). Deficiency of ASPA leads to elevation of N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid (NAA) in the brain and urine. To explore the feasibility of gene transfer to replace ASPA in CD, we generated a knockout mouse and constructed an AAV vector that encodes human ASPA cDNA (hASPA) followed by green fluorescent protein (GFP) after an intraribosomal entry site. We injected CD mice with rAAV-hASPA-GFP in the striatum and thalamus or injected rAAV-GFP identically into control animals. Three to five months after the injection, we determined the presence of ASPA in the CD mouse brain by ASPA activity assay, GFP expression, and Western blot analysis. While rAAV-GFP-injected animals displayed undetectable levels of ASPA, all detection methods revealed significant ASPA levels in rAAV-hASPA-GFP-injected CD mice. We evaluated the functional effects of rAAV-hASPA-GFP-mediated ASPA expression by standard histological methods, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) for in vivo NAA levels, and magnetic resonance imaging of CD mice. rAAV-hASPA-injected animals displayed a remarkable lack of spongiform degeneration in the thalamus. However, pathology in sites unrelated to the injected areas showed no improvement in histopathology. The improvement in thalamic neuropathology was also detectable via in vivo MRI. MRS revealed that in vivo NAA levels were also reduced. These data indicate that rAAV-mediated ASPA delivery may be an interesting avenue for the treatment of CD.</ab>

<ab>A series of contiguous 30-bp deletions were introduced into the regions upstream of the p19 and p40 promoters of adeno-associated virus (AAV), and the effects of these deletions on induction of AAV transcription by the rep gene products was evaluated. A novel complementation system was devised for supplying wild-type Rep protein when mutations disrupted the trans activation activity of the Rep protein. Transcription from the p40 promoter was eliminated upon deletion of the TATA sequence located between -4 and -33 from the cap site. Deletions which removed sequences from -34 to -123 bp from the p40 mRNA start site substantially reduced Rep induction of p40 transcription. p19 transcription was also undetectable when the p19 TATA sequence between -4 and -33 was deleted. In contrast to the p40 region, two types of cis-active sequences were found associated with the p19 promoter. Sequences between -4 and -63 bp relative to the p19 cap site were essential for Rep induction only from the p19 promoter. Deletions between -94 and -153 bp relative to the p19 cap site reduced Rep induction of both the p19 and p40 promoters coordinately. These two noncontiguous regions were separated by a 30-bp sequence that was not essential for transcription control. Further deletion analysis delineated a second cis-active element, associated with the p5 promoter (AAV nucleotides 191 to 320), which was also necessary for coordinate Rep activation of both the p19 and p40 promoters. Finally, the dependence of p40 transcription on the Rep-responsive elements within the p5 and p19 regions could be overcome by the presence of the AAV terminal repeats, suggesting that the terminal repeats contained redundant Rep-responsive elements. These results implied an interdependence in cis between the three AAV promoters and suggested a novel mechanism for coordinate regulation of gene expression in response to the trans-activating Rep protein. Coordinate induction appeared to be the result of a simultaneous interaction between the Rep protein and sequence elements associated with two or all three of the AAV promoters.</ab>

<ab>The adeno-associated virus (AAV) Rep protein is required for both viral DNA replication and transactivation of the AAV promoters. Here we report the effects of mutations in the rep gene on transcription and replication in vivo and terminal repeat binding and terminal resolution site (trs) endonuclease activities in vitro. In all, we examined 10 in-frame deletions and 14 amino acid substitution mutations at eight positions. The point mutations were targeted to regions that are highly conserved among the parvovirus nonstructural proteins and include the extended ATPase domain of the AAV Rep protein. The mutations identify at least two noncontiguous regions of Rep which are essential for terminal repeat binding (amino acids 134 to 242 and amino acids 415 to 490). Mutations in either region render the protein inactive for both DNA replication and transactivation. In addition, mutations within a putative ATPase region also cause defects in replication and transactivation in vivo as well as in the ATP-dependent trs endonuclease activity in vitro. These results suggest that Rep transactivates via a novel mechanism which may require both DNA binding and an enzymatic activity, namely, ATPase or DNA helicase activity.</ab>

<ab>We have used baculovirus-expressed Rep68 that has been purified to homogeneity to reexamine the binding properties of the Rep protein. We find that Rep68 is capable of binding to a linear DNA sequence that is contained within a 25-bp sequence of the A stem of the adeno-associated virus (AAV) terminal repeat proximal to the B and C palindromes. This has been shown conclusively by demonstrating that Rep68 could specifically bind to a synthetic oligonucleotide containing the 25-bp region in the absence of the other sequences within the terminal repeat. Rep78 was also capable of binding the A stem recognition element, as demonstrated by the fact that a DNA affinity column containing the 25-bp sequence can be used to purify Rep78. The ability to recognize the linear DNA sequence within the A stem provides a mechanism by which the Rep protein can be oriented on the terminal repeat so that only the correct strand is cut at the terminal resolution site (trs site) during terminal resolution. In addition, computer analysis suggests that sequences similar to the A stem element are present within the three AAV promoter regions. Electrophoretic mobility shift experiments clearly demonstrate that the p5 promoter contains a Rep binding sequence. DNase protection experiments indicate that the Rep binding sequence within the p5 promoter is located between the YY1 initiator sequence and the TATA binding site. This position immediately suggests a mechanism by which the Rep protein could act as a repressor or a transactivator of p5 transcription by interacting with either YY1 or TBP. In addition, gel shift experiments suggest that the p19 promoter also contains a Rep binding site. The presence of Rep binding sites upstream of both promoters suggests that these sites may be involved in coordinate regulation of AAV transcription. In addition, we have identified a heterologous Rep binding sequence within pBR322 DNA. A comparison of the sequences within the A stem, p5, and pBR322 binding sites suggests that a repeating GAGC motif is at least part of the Rep recognition sequence. In the accompanying report (D. M. McCarty, J. H. Ryan, S. Zolutukhin, X. Zhou, and N. Muzyczka, J. Virol. 68:4998-5006, 1994), we examine the relative affinity of Rep to the A stem site and the complete terminal repeat. Finally, we also have reexamined the ability of Rep68 and Rep78 to cut at the trs site in substrates that do not contain the B and C palindromes or any apparent secondary structure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</ab>

<ab>We have characterized a Rep binding sequence which is within the A stem region of the adeno-associated virus terminal repeat (TR) and compared its affinity with that of the complete hairpinned TR for pure Rep68. Both the A stem and the complete TR substrates produced a complex pattern of protein-DNA complexes in which at least six different bound species could be distinguished. Competition experiments suggested that the dissociation constant for the A stem sequence is approximately 125-fold higher than that for the complete TR. The competition experiments also suggested that the average number of Rep molecules per TR substrate molecule under conditions of saturating substrate is 3.7:1, while for the A stem substrate, the ratio is 10:1. In spite of the apparent difference in protein-to-DNA ratio in the complexes, no major difference was seen in the mobility or the pattern of the protein-DNA complexes with the two kinds of substrates, suggesting that the difference in protein-to-DNA ratio was due to the lower stability of the A stem complex rather than the actual number of Rep molecules per DNA molecule. At least some of the difference in stability of the two kinds of complexes was due to the fact that the dissociation rate of the A stem substrate from the protein-DNA complexes was approximately fourfold faster than that of the complete TR. The dissociation rate curves for both substrates, however, were complex, suggesting that substrate was being released from at least two different kinds of protein-DNA complexes at different rates. In addition, we have analyzed binding to several substitution mutants within the A stem of the TR. A five-base mutant near the terminal resolution site (trs site) had little effect on binding. Two other mutants produced seven- or five-base substitutions within the 25-bp sequence of the A stem that had been identified in the accompanying report (D. M. McCarty, D. J. Pereira, I. Zolotukhin, X. Zhou, J. H. Ryan, and N. Muzyczka, J. Virol. 68:4988-4997, 1994) as essential for binding. Each of these mutants eliminated some but not all of the repeating GAGC motifs in the 25-bp A stem region. Both of these mutants completely abolished binding to the A stem substrate but only partially reduced binding in the context of the complete hairpinned TR. Furthermore, neither mutant altered the pattern of Rep-DNA complexes produced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</ab>

<ab>We used two kinds of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors to transduce the neomycin resistance gene into human cells. The first of these (dl52-91) retains the AAV rep genes; the second (dl3-94) retains only the AAV terminal repeats and the AAV polyadenylation signal (428 base pairs). Both vectors could be packaged into AAV virions and produced proviral structures that were essentially the same. Thus, the AAV sequences that are required in cis for packaging (pac), integration (int), rescue (res), and replication (ori) of viral DNA are located within a 284-base-pair sequence that includes the terminal repeat. Most of the G418r cell lines (73%) contained proviruses which could be rescued (Res+) when the cells were superinfected with the appropriate helper viruses. Some produced high yields of viral DNA; other rescued at a 50-fold lower level. Most of the lines that were Res+ (79%) contained a tandem repeat of the AAV genome (2 to 20 copies) which was integrated randomly with respect to cellular DNA. Junctions between two consecutive AAV copies in a tandem array contained either one or two copies of the AAV terminal palindrome. Junctions between AAV and cellular sequences occurred predominantly at or within the AAV terminal repeat, but in some cases at internal AAV sequences. Two lines were seen that contained free episomal copies of AAV DNA. Res+ clones contained deleted proviruses or tandem repeats of a deleted genome. Occasionally, flanking cellular DNA was also amplified. There was no superinfection inhibition of AAV DNA integration. Our results suggest that AAV sequences are amplified by DNA replication either before or after integration and that the mechanism of replication is different from the one used during AAV lytic infections. In addition, we have described a new AAV general transduction vector, dl3-94, which provides the maximum amount of room for insertion of foreign DNA and integrates at a high frequency (80%).</ab>

<ab>Crystals of baculovirus-expressed adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (AAV1) capsids have been grown in the rhombohedral space group R32 (unit-cell parameters a = 254.7 A, alpha = 62.3 degrees) and shown to diffract X-rays to at least 2.5 A resolution. The diffraction data were subsequently processed and reduced with an overall R(sym) of 12.3% and a completeness of 89.0%. Based on the unit-cell volume, rotation-function and translation-function results and packing considerations, there is one virus capsid (60 viral proteins) per unit cell and there are ten viral proteins per crystallographic asymmetric unit. The AAV1 capsid shares both the twofold and threefold crystallographic symmetry operators. The AAV1 data have been initially phased using a polyalanine model (based on the crystal structure of AAV4) to 4.0 A resolution and the structure determination and refinement is in progress using tenfold noncrystallographic symmetry electron-density averaging.</ab>

<ab>Adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 9, which is under development for gene-delivery applications, shows significantly enhanced capsid-associated transduction efficiency in muscle compared with other AAV serotypes. With the aim of characterizing the structural determinants of this property, the purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic analyses of the AAV9 viral capsid are reported. The crystals diffracted X-rays to 2.8 A resolution using synchrotron radiation and belonged to the trigonal space group P3(2), with unit-cell parameters a = b = 251.0, c = 640.0 A. There are three complete viral capsids in the crystal unit cell. The orientation and position of the asymmetric unit capsid have been determined by molecular-replacement methods and structure determination is in progress.</ab>

<ab>A new reiterated variant of simian virus 40 (SV40; dl1142) has been constructed. It should be useful for the purpose of cloning foreign pieces of DNA in SV40 virions. Up to 80% of the SV40 genome has been made available for substitution with foreign DNA and the vector contains a number of unique (single-cut) restriction sites which will facilitate cloning. The 5&amp;#39; and 3&amp;#39; regions of both the SV40 early and late messenger RNAs are included in the vector. Prokaryotic DNA has been successfully cloned in the early region of the vector. The transcriptional properties of the recombinant have been studied, and it was found that both the vector and insert DNA are transcribed, mainly as non-adenylated RNA.</ab>

<ab>To test the suitability of simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA as a vector for inserting DNA segments into the chromosomes of mammalian cells, an EcoRI-A fragment of bacteriophage lambda DNA was covalently joined to a fragment of SV40 DNA and used to transform mouse cells in culture. Three independent, morphologically transformed clones were obtained that were positive for SV40 T-antigen by immunofluorescence staining. DNA from each transformant was examined by restriction enzyme analysis and found to contain both lambda and SV40 sequences. Co-migration of some fragments containing lambda and SV40 sequences following digestion of transformed cell DNA by each of four different restriction enzymes indicated that part of the retained lambda and SV40 DNA was linked in two of the three lines. In the third line, however, none of the restriction fragments had both lambda and SV40 sequences. Although the presence of non-integrated lambda DNA was not excluded, at least some of the lambda DNA appeared to be linked to host cell DNA. Results of digestion by EcoRI suggested that in some cases the transforming linear molecule had probably circularized prior to integration.</ab>

<ab>Recombinant gene delivery vehicles based on adeno-associated virus (rAAV) have emerged as promising vectors for the correction of genetic and acquired human disease states. These vectors possess many characteristics, including low pathogenicity and immunogenicity, and long-term gene expression after a single administered dose, that make them leading candidates for clinical gene therapy applications. Yet, the broad tissue tropism of the available AAV serotypes remains a disadvantage for the safest, most effective in vivo delivery of transgenes to target tissues. In addition, clinically relevant cell types exist that are poorly transduced by current rAAV vectors. As a result, increased efforts are now being made to tailor the tropism of rAAV to improve their transduction and selectivity profiles. Flexible, diverse methodologies have emerged that allow more control over the cell surface receptors rAAV employs for cell entry. These novel rAAV production strategies have resulted in unique vectors characterized by unique capsid protein sequences that employ alternative receptors, and have provided a better understanding of many basic aspects of the rAAV life cycle. This review aims to summarize the genetic methods currently being employed to customize rAAV capsids.</ab>

<ab>Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are being developed as gene therapy vectors, and their efficacy could be improved by a detailed understanding of their viral capsid structures. AAV serotype 8 (AAV8) shows a significantly greater liver transduction efficiency than those of other serotypes, which has resulted in efforts to develop this virus as a gene therapy vector for hemophilia A and familial hypercholesterolemia. Pseudotyping studies show that the differential tissue tropism and transduction efficiencies exhibited by the AAVs result from differences in their capsid viral protein (VP) amino acids. Towards identifying the structural features underpinning these disparities, we report the crystal structure of the AAV8 viral capsid determined to 2.6-A resolution. The overall topology of its common overlapping VP is similar to that previously reported for the crystal structures of AAV2 and AAV4, with an eight-stranded beta-barrel and long loops between the beta-strands. The most significant structural differences between AAV8 and AAV2 (the best-characterized serotype) are located on the capsid surface at protrusions surrounding the two-, three-, and fivefold axes at residues reported to control transduction efficiency and antibody recognition for AAV2. In addition, a comparison of the AAV8 and AAV2 capsid surface amino acids showed a reduced distribution of basic charge for AAV8 at the mapped AAV2 heparin sulfate receptor binding region, consistent with an observed non-heparin-binding phenotype for AAV8. Thus, this AAV8 structure provides an additional platform for mutagenesis efforts to characterize AAV capsid regions responsible for differential cellular tropism, transduction, and antigenicity for these promising gene therapy vectors.</ab>

<ab>Adeno-associated virus (AAV) replicates its DNA by a modified rolling-circle mechanism that exclusively uses leading strand displacement synthesis. To identify the enzymes directly involved in AAV DNA replication, we fractionated adenovirus-infected crude extracts and tested them in an in vitro replication system that required the presence of the AAV-encoded Rep protein and the AAV origins of DNA replication, thus faithfully reproducing in vivo viral DNA replication. Fractions that contained replication factor C (RFC) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were found to be essential for reconstituting AAV DNA replication. These could be replaced by purified PCNA and RFC to retain full activity. We also found that fractions containing polymerase delta, but not polymerase epsilon or alpha, were capable of replicating AAV DNA in vitro. This was confirmed when highly purified polymerase delta complex purified from baculovirus expression clones was used. Curiously, as the components of the DNA replication system were purified, neither the cellular single-stranded DNA binding protein (RPA) nor the adenovirus-encoded DNA binding protein was found to be essential for DNA replication; both only modestly stimulated DNA synthesis on an AAV template. Also, in addition to polymerase delta, RFC, and PCNA, an as yet unidentified factor(s) is required for AAV DNA replication, which appeared to be enriched in adenovirus-infected cells. Finally, the absence of any apparent cellular DNA helicase requirement led us to develop an artificial AAV replication system in which polymerase delta, RFC, and PCNA were replaced with T4 DNA polymerase and gp32 protein. This system was capable of supporting AAV DNA replication, demonstrating that under some conditions the Rep helicase activity can function to unwind duplex DNA during strand displacement synthesis.</ab>

<ab>Adeno-associated virus (AAV) replicates its DNA exclusively by a leading-strand DNA replication mechanism and requires coinfection with a helper virus, such as adenovirus, to achieve a productive infection. In previous work, we described an in vitro AAV replication assay that required the AAV terminal repeats (the origins for DNA replication), the AAV Rep protein (the origin binding protein), and an adenovirus-infected crude extract. Fractionation of these crude extracts identified replication factor C (RFC), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and polymerase delta as cellular enzymes that were essential for AAV DNA replication in vitro. Here we identify the remaining factor that is necessary as the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex, a cellular helicase complex that is believed to be the replicative helicase for eukaryotic chromosomes. Thus, polymerase delta, RFC, PCNA, and the MCM complex, along with the virally encoded Rep protein, constitute the minimal protein complexes required to reconstitute efficient AAV DNA replication in vitro. Interfering RNAs targeted to MCM and polymerase delta inhibited AAV DNA replication in vivo, suggesting that one or more components of the MCM complex and polymerase delta play an essential role in AAV DNA replication in vivo as well as in vitro. Our reconstituted in vitro DNA replication system is consistent with the current genetic information about AAV DNA replication. The use of highly conserved cellular replication enzymes may explain why AAV is capable of productive infection in a wide variety of species with several different families of helper viruses.</ab>

<ab>Adeno-associated virus (AAV) codes for four related nonstructural Rep proteins. AAV both replicates and assembles in the nucleus and requires coinfection with a helper virus, either adenovirus (Ad) or herpesvirus, for a productive infection. Like other more complex DNA viruses, it is believed that AAV interacts or modifies host cell proteins to carry out its infection cycle. To date, relatively little is known about the host proteins that interact with the viral Rep proteins, which are known to be directly involved in DNA replication, control of viral and cellular transcription, splicing, and protein translation. In this study, we used affinity-tagged Rep protein to purify cellular protein complexes that were associated with Rep in cells that had been infected with Ad and AAV. In all, we identified 188 cellular proteins from 16 functional categories, including 14 transcription factors, 6 translation factors, 15 potential splicing proteins, 5 proteins involved in protein degradation, and 13 proteins involved in DNA replication or repair. This dramatically increases the number of potential interactions over the current number of approximately 26. Twelve of the novel proteins found were further tested by coimmunoprecipitation or colocalization using confocal immunomicroscopy. Of these, 10 were confirmed as proteins that formed complexes with Rep, including proteins of the MCM complex (DNA replication), RCN1 (membrane transport), SMC2 (chromatin dynamics), EDD1 (ubiquitin ligase), IRS4 (signal transduction), and FUS (splicing). Computer analysis suggested that 45 and 28 of the 188 proteins could be placed in a pathway of interacting proteins involved in DNA replication and protein synthesis, respectively. Of the proteins involved in DNA replication, all of the previously identified proteins involved in AAV DNA replication were found, except Ad DBP. The only Ad protein found to interact with Rep was the E1b55K protein. In addition, we confirmed that Rep interacts with Ku70/80 helicase. In vitro DNA synthesis assays demonstrated that although Ku helicase activity could substitute for MCM to promote strand displacement synthesis, its presence was not essential. Our study suggests that the interaction of AAV with cellular proteins is much more complex than previously suspected and provides a resource for further studies of the AAV life cycle.</ab>

<ab>We previously reported the development of an in vitro adeno-associated virus (AAV) DNA replication system. The system required one of the p5 Rep proteins encoded by AAV (either Rep78 or Rep68) and a crude adenovirus (Ad)-infected HeLa cell cytoplasmic extract to catalyze origin of replication-dependent AAV DNA replication. However, in addition to fully permissive DNA replication, which occurs in the presence of Ad, AAV is also capable of partially permissive DNA replication in the absence of the helper virus in cells that have been treated with genotoxic agents. Limited DNA replication also occurs in the absence of Ad during the process of establishing a latent infection. In an attempt to isolate uninfected extracts that would support AAV DNA replication, we discovered that HeLa cell extracts grown to high density can occasionally display as much in vitro replication activity as Ad-infected extracts. This finding confirmed previous genetic analyses which suggested that no Ad-encoded proteins were absolutely essential for AAV DNA replication and that the uninfected extracts should be useful for studying the differences between helper-dependent and helper-independent AAV DNA replication. Using specific chemical inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, as well as the fractionation of uninfected HeLa extracts, we identified several of the cellular enzymes involved in AAV DNA replication. They were the single-stranded DNA binding protein, replication protein A (RFA), the 3&amp;#39; primer binding complex, replication factor C (RFC), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Consistent with the current model for AAV DNA replication, which requires only leading-strand DNA synthesis, we found no requirement for DNA polymerase alpha-primase. AAV DNA replication could be reconstituted with purified Rep78, RPA, RFC, and PCNA and a phosphocellulose chromatography fraction (IIA) that contained DNA polymerase activity. As both RFC and PCNA are known to be accessory proteins for polymerase delta and epsilon, we attempted to reconstitute AAV DNA replication by substituting either purified polymerase delta or polymerase epsilon for fraction IIA. These attempts were unsuccessful and suggested that some novel cellular protein or modification was required for AAV DNA replication that had not been previously identified. Finally, we also further characterized the in vitro DNA replication assay and demonstrated by two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis that all of the intermediates commonly seen in vivo are generated in the in vitro system. The only difference was an accumulation of single-stranded DNA in vivo that was not seen in vitro. The 2D data also suggested that although both Rep78 and Rep68 can generate dimeric intermediates in vitro, Rep68 is more efficient in processing dimers to monomer duplex DNA. Regardless of the Rep that was used in vitro, we found evidence of an interaction between the elongation complex and the terminal repeats. Nicking at the terminal repeats of a replicating molecule appeared to be inhibited until after elongation was complete.</ab>

<ab>The study of eukaryotic viral DNA replication in vitro has led to the identification of cellular enzymes involved in DNA replication. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is distinct from previously reported systems in that it is believed to replicate entirely by leading-strand DNA synthesis and requires coinfection with adenovirus to establish completely permissive replication. In previous work, we demonstrated that two of the AAV nonstructural proteins, Rep78 and -68, are site-specific endonucleases and DNA helicases that are capable of resolving covalently closed AAV termini, a key step in AAV DNA replication. We have now cloned the AAV nonstructural proteins Rep78, Rep68, and Rep52 in the baculovirus expression system. Using the baculovirus-expressed proteins, we have developed an efficient in vitro AAV DNA replication system which mimics the in vivo behavior of AAV in every respect. With no-end AAV DNA as the starting substrate, the reaction required an adenovirus-infected cell extract and the presence of either Rep78 or Rep68. Rep52, as expected, did not support DNA replication. A mutant in the AAV terminal resolution site (trs) was defective for DNA replication in the in vitro assay. Little, if any, product was formed in the absence of the adenovirus-infected HeLa cell extract. In general, uninfected HeLa extracts were less efficient in supporting AAV DNA replication than adenovirus-infected extracts. Thus, the requirement for adenovirus infection in vivo was partially duplicated in vitro. The reduced ability of uninfected HeLa extracts to support complete DNA replication was not due to a defect in terminal resolution but rather to a defect in the reinitiation reaction or in elongation. Rep78 produced a characteristic monomer-dimer pattern of replicative intermediates, but surprisingly, Rep68 produced little, if any, dimer replicative form. The reaction had a significant lag (30 min) before incorporation of 32P-deoxynucleoside triphosphate could be detected in DpnI-resistant monomer replicative form and was linear for at least 4 h after the lag. The rate of incorporation in the reaction was comparable to that in the simian virus 40 in vitro system. Replication of the complete AAV DNA molecule was demonstrated by the following criteria. (i) Most of the monomer and dimer product DNAs were completely resistant to digestion with DpnI. (ii) Virtually all of the starting substrate was converted to heavy-light or heavy-heavy product DNA in the presence of bromo-dUTP when examined on CsCl density gradients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</ab>

<ab>The adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV2) uses heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) as its primary cellular receptor. In order to identify amino acids within the capsid of AAV2 that contribute to HSPG association, we used biochemical information about heparin and heparin sulfate, AAV serotype protein sequence alignments, and data from previous capsid studies to select residues for mutagenesis. Charged-to-alanine substitution mutagenesis was performed on individual residues and combinations of basic residues for the production and purification of recombinant viruses that contained a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene cassette. Intact capsids were assayed for their ability to bind to heparin-agarose in vitro, and virions that packaged DNA were assayed for their ability to transduce normally permissive cell lines. We found that mutation of arginine residues at position 585 or 588 eliminated binding to heparin-agarose. Mutation of residues R484, R487, and K532 showed partial binding to heparin-agarose. We observed a general correlation between heparin-agarose binding and infectivity as measured by GFP transduction; however, a subset of mutants that partially bound heparin-agarose (R484A and K532A) were completely noninfectious, suggesting that they had additional blocks to infectivity that were unrelated to heparin binding. Conservative mutation of positions R585 and R588 to lysine slightly reduced heparin-agarose binding and had comparable effects on infectivity. Substitution of AAV2 residues 585 through 590 into a location predicted to be structurally equivalent in AAV5 generated a hybrid virus that bound to heparin-agarose efficiently and was able to package DNA but was noninfectious. Taken together, our results suggest that residues R585 and R588 are primarily responsible for heparin sulfate binding and that mutation of these residues has little effect on other aspects of the viral life cycle. Interactive computer graphics examination of the AAV2 VP3 atomic coordinates revealed that residues which contribute to heparin binding formed a cluster of five basic amino acids that presented toward the icosahedral threefold axis from the surrounding spike protrusion. Three other kinds of mutants were identified. Mutants R459A, H509A, and H526A/K527A bound heparin at levels comparable to that of wild-type virus but were defective for transduction. Another mutant, H358A, was defective for capsid assembly. Finally, an R459A mutant produced significantly lower levels of full capsids, suggesting a packaging defect.</ab>

<ab>Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a member of the Parvoviridae, belonging to the Dependovirus genus. Currently, several distinct isolates of AAV are in development for use in human gene therapy applications due to their ability to transduce different target cells. The need to manipulate AAV capsids for specific tissue delivery has generated interest in understanding their capsid structures. The structure of AAV type 4 (AAV4), one of the most antigenically distinct serotypes, was determined to 13-A resolution by cryo-electron microscopy and image reconstruction. A pseudoatomic model was built for the AAV4 capsid by use of a structure-based sequence alignment of its major capsid protein, VP3, with that of AAV2, to which AAV4 is 58% identical and constrained by its reconstructed density envelope. The model showed variations in the surface loops that may account for the differences in receptor binding and antigenicity between AAV2 and AAV4. The AAV4 capsid surface topology also shows an unpredicted structural similarity to that of Aleutian mink disease virus and human parvovirus B19, autonomous members of the genus, despite limited sequence homology.</ab>

<ab>Epidemiological studies report that 80% of the population maintains antibodies (Ab) to wild-type (wt) adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV2), with 30% expressing neutralizing Ab (NAb). The blood-brain barrier (BBB) provides limited immune privilege to brain parenchyma, and the immune response to recombinant AAV (rAAV) administration in the brain of a naive animal is minimal. However, central nervous system transduction in preimmunized animals remains unstudied. Vector administration may disrupt the BBB sufficiently to promote an immune response in a previously immunized animal. We tested the hypothesis that intracerebral rAAV administration and readministration would not be affected by the presence of circulating Ab to wt AAV2. Rats peripherally immunized with live wt AAV2 and naive controls were tested with single intrastriatal injections of rAAV2 encoding human glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) or green fluorescent protein (GFP). Striatal readministration of rAAV2-GDNF was also tested in preimmunized and naive rats. Finally, serotype specificity of the immunization against wt AAV2 was examined by single injections of rAAV5-GFP. Preimmunization resulted in high levels of circulating NAb and prevented transduction by rAAV2 as assessed by striatal GDNF levels. rAAV2-GFP striatal transduction was also prevented by immunization, while rAAV5-GFP-mediated transduction, as assessed by stereological cell counting, was unaffected. Additionally, inflammatory markers were present in those animals that received repeated administrations of rAAV2, including markers of a cell-mediated immune response and cytotoxic damage. A live virus immunization protocol generated the circulating anti-wt-AAV Ab seen in this experiment, while human titers are commonly acquired via natural infection. Regardless, the data show that the presence of high levels of NAb against wt AAV can reduce rAAV-mediated transduction in the brain and should be accounted for in future experiments utilizing this vector.</ab>

<ab>Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) expresses no viral genes after transduction. In addition, because the brain is relatively immunoprivileged, intracranial rAAV transduction may be immunologically benign due to a lack of antigen presentation. However, preexposure to AAV allows neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) to block brain transduction and rAAV readministration in the brain leads to an inflammatory response in the second-injection site. In this study, we replicate our striatal rAAV2/2-GDNF readministration results and extend this effect to a second transgene, green fluorescent protein (GFP). Unlike rAAV2/2-GDNF readministration, striatal rAAV2/2-GFP readministration leads to a loss of transgene in the second site in the absence of detectable circulating nAbs. In order to determine whether the transgene or the AAV2 capsid is the antigenic stimulus in brain for the immune response in the second site, we readministered rAAV2/2-GFP using two different rAAV serotypes (rAAV2/2 followed by rAAV2/5). In this case, there was no striatal inflammation or transgene loss detected in the second-injection site. In addition, striatal readministration of rAAV2/5-GFP also resulted in no detectable immune response. Furthermore, delaying rAAV2/2 striatal readministration to a 11-week interval abrogated the immune response in the second-injection site. Finally, while striatal readministration of rAAV2/2 leads to significant loss of transgene in the second-injection site, this effect is not due to loss of vector genomes as determined by quantitative real-time PCR. We conclude that intracellular processing of AAV capsids after transduction is the immunogenic antigen and capsid serotypes that are processed more quickly than rAAV2/2 are less immunogenic.</ab>

<ab>In this study, we have evaluated the capacity of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors, containing cell type-specific promoters, to transduce neurons in vivo in the normal adult rat spinal cord. The neuron-specific enolase (NSE) promoter and the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B-chain promoter were used to direct expression of a &amp;#39;humanized&amp;#39; form of the gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP). Neuron-specific rAAVs were injected into the mid-cervical regions of adult rat spinal cords. At 10-14 days, expression was detected in all animals and persisted for up to 15 weeks. Immunocytochemical and morphological profiles of transduced cells were consistently neuronal, and there was no evidence of transgene expression in glial elements. Transduction efficiencies for the NSE and PDGF rAAVs were estimated at 15 and 45 infectious particles per GFP-positive neuron, respectively, in the absence of detectable adenovirus. This study strongly supports a role for rAAV vectors in CNS gene therapy and lays the groundwork for delivery of more functional genes to spinal cord neurons as a possible way to enhance spinal cord repair following injury.</ab>

<ab>Adeno-associated virus (AAV) uses three promoters, p5, p19, and p40, to regulate viral gene expression. The p5 and p19 promoters direct the synthesis of the viral regulatory proteins, Rep78 and -68 and Rep52 and -40, respectively. The p5 Rep proteins bind a linear 22-bp sequence, the Rep binding element (RBE), that is within both the terminal repeat (TR) and the p5 promoter. In the absence of helper virus, all four Rep proteins have been shown to reduce transcription from the viral p5 and p19 promoters. In this report, we focus on the roles of these proteins and the RBEs in controlling transcription during a productive infection, that is, in the presence of adenovirus. We find that in the presence of adenovirus, the p5 RBE represses p5 transcription while the RBE in the TR activates p5. However, both the TR RBE and the p5 RBE transactivate the p19 and p40 promoters. The fact that the p5 RBE-Rep complex can transactivate p19 and p40 while repressing p5 suggests that Rep78/68 is both a repressor and a transactivator. Rep repression of p5 is specific for the p5 RBE, as other p5 promoter elements do not support this activity. We also demonstrate that in the presence of adenovirus, the p19 Rep proteins, which do not bind to the RBE, can eliminate repression of the p5 promoter by Rep78 and Rep68. This may occur by the association of Rep52 with Rep78 or Rep68 to produce a Rep78/68-Rep52 protein complex which can be detected in vivo by immunoprecipitation. Finally, two Rep mutants that were deficient in RBE binding and transactivation but positive for p5 repression were identified. These mutants may define interaction domains involved in making contacts with other proteins that facilitate repression. These observations suggest a mechanism for controlling the p5 and p19 mRNA levels during a productive AAV infection.</ab>

<ab>We have identified the sequence elements that are required for adeno-associated virus type 2 p40 promoter activity. Mutation of specific promoter elements showed that two Sp1 sites at approximately -50 (Sp1-50) and -70 (GGT-70) bp upstream of the start of the p40 messages were necessary for maximal promoter activity. As expected, the TATA site at -30 was also essential. In vitro DNA binding experiments confirmed that the Sp1-50 and GGT-70 sites were bound by Sp1 or Sp1-like proteins. Two other transcription elements, the ATF-80 and AP1-40 sites, may play a role in p40 activity. Mutation of these elements resulted in a modest decrease in p40 transcription, but DNA binding experiments did not clearly demonstrate binding of transcription factors to these sites. In contrast, a major late transcription factor site at -110 was shown to bind the transcription factor, but mutation of this site had no effect on p40 activity. In a previous report, we have shown that transactivation of the p40 promoter by the viral Rep proteins required an upstream Rep binding element (in the terminal repeat or the p5 promoter), an unidentified p19 promoter element, and a p40 promoter element (D. J. Pereira and N. Muzyczka, J. Virol. 71:1747-1756, 1997). Here we demonstrate that the CArG-140 element in the p19 promoter and the Sp1-50 element in the p40 promoter are the specific p19 and p40 elements required for Rep induction of p40. As in the case of the p19 promoter, Sp1 facilitates interaction of Rep with the p40 promoter by interaction of the two proteins. Furthermore, electron microscopy experiments demonstrated that when Rep is bound to an upstream Rep binding element, it can interact with a proximal Sp1 site by protein contacts and create a loop in the intervening DNA. This finding suggests a common mechanism whereby the Rep binding element in the TR or the p5 promoter induces p19 and p40 activity by interaction with their respective Sp1 sites.</ab>

<ab>Control of adeno-associated virus (AAV) transcription from the three AAV promoters (p5, p19, and p40) requires the adenovirus E1a protein and the AAV nonstructural (Rep) proteins. The Rep proteins have been shown to repress the AAV p5 promoter yet facilitate activation of the p19 and p40 promoters during a productive infection. To elucidate the mechanism of promoter regulation by the AAV Rep proteins, the cellular factors involved in mediating Rep activation of the p19 promoter were characterized. A series of protein-DNA binding experiments using extracts derived from uninfected HeLa cells was performed to identify cellular factors that bind to the p19 promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays, DNase I protection analyses, and UV cross-linking experiments demonstrated specific interactions with the cellular factor SP1 (or an SP1-like protein) at positions -50 and -130 relative to the start of p19 transcription. Additionally, an unknown cellular protein (cellular AAV activating protein [cAAP]) with an approximate molecular mass of 34 kDa was found to interact with a CArG-like element at position -140. Mutational analysis of the p19 promoter suggested that the SP1 site at -50 and the cAAP site at -140 were necessary to mediate Rep activation of p19. Antibody precipitation experiments demonstrated that Rep-SP1 protein complexes can exist in vivo. Although Rep was demonstrated to interact with p19 DNA directly, the affinity of Rep binding was much lower than that seen for the Rep binding elements within the terminal repeat and the p5 promoter. Furthermore, the interaction of purified Rep68 with the p19 promoter in vitro was negligible unless purified SP1 was also added to the reaction. Thus, the ability of Rep to transactivate the p19 promoter is likely to involve SP1-Rep protein contacts that facilitate Rep interaction with p19 DNA.</ab>

<ab>PstI restriction fragments of the colicin Ib (ColIb) plasmid have been cloned into the Apr gene of the pBR322 vector. Colicin-producing clones (Col+) all contained two common PstI (L and U) fragments, 2000 and 800 bp long, respectively. All of these colicin producers were found to permit the normal growth of bacteriophage T5; the presence of the whole ColIb plasmid causes an abortive T5 or BF23 phage infection. None of the other clones selected for their inability to propagate T5 produced colicin. The clones (Abi+) that permitted only an abortive infection by T5 contained a single restriction fragment, O (1600 bp), which was not found in any of the colicin producers. Likewise, the specific fragments (L and U) found in the Col+ clones were not found in the Abi+ clones. These data are very hard to reconcile with the hypothesis of a colicin-induced cell deterioration after T5 phage infection.</ab>

<ab>Most obese animal models, whether associated with genetic, diet-induced, or age-related obesity, display pronounced leptin resistance, rendering leptin supplement therapy ineffective in treating obesity. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) has been recently used to invoke leptin-like signaling pathways, thereby circumventing leptin resistance. In the current study, we characterize immediate and long-term molecular events in the hypothalamus of rats exposed to the sustained ectopic expression of leptin, CNTF, or leukemia inhibitory factor, another neurocytokine of IL-6 family, all delivered centrally via a viral vector. The respective transgene-encoded ligands induced similar but not identical metabolic responses as assessed by the reduction in body weight gain and changes in food intake. To define molecular mechanisms of weight-reducing and anorexigenic action of cytokines, we have analyzed the gene expression profiles of 1300 brain-specific genes in the hypothalami of normal rats subjected to the prolonged cytokine action for 10 wk. We present evidence that constitutive expression of cytokines in the brain induces changes in gene expression characteristic of chronic inflammation leading to either temporal weight reduction (CNTF) or severe cachexia (leukemia inhibitory factor). Our results convey a cautionary note regarding potential use of the tested cytokines in therapeutic applications.</ab>

The crystals belong to the rhombohedral space group R3, with unit-cell parameters a = 252.4, c = 591.2 A in the hexagonal setting. The diffraction data were processed and reduced to an overall completeness of 79.0% and an R(merge) of 12.0%. There are three viral capsids in the unit cell. The icosahedral threefold axis is coincident with the crystallographic threefold axis, resulting in one third of a capsid (20 monomers) per crystallographic asymmetric unit. The orientation of the viral capsid has been determined by rotation-function searches and is positioned at (0, 0, 0) by packing considerations.</ab>

<ab>We analyzed the biological activity of an amber mutation, am404, at map position 0.27 in the T antigen gene of simian virus 40. Immunoprecipitation of extracts from am404-infected cells demonstrated the presence of an amber protein fragment (am T antigen) of the expected molecular weight (67,000). Differential immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibody demonstrated that am T antigen was missing the carboxy-terminal antigenic determinants. The amber mutant was shown to be defective for most of the functions associated with wild-type T antigen. The mutant did not replicate autonomously, but this defect could be complemented by a helper virus (D. R. Rawlins and N. Muzyczka, J. Virol. 36:611-616, 1980). The mutant failed to transform nonpermissive rodent cells and did not relieve the host range restriction of adenovirus 2 in monkey cells. However, stimulation of host cell DNA, whose functional region domain has been mapped within that portion of the protein synthesized by the mutant, could be demonstrated in am404-infected cells. A number of unexpected observations were made. First, the am T antigen was produced in unusually large amounts in a simian virus 40-transformed monkey cell line (COS-1), but overproduction was not seen in nontransformed monkey cells regardless of whether or not a helper virus was present. This feature of the mutant was presumably the result of the inability of am T antigen to autoregulate, the level of wild-type T antigen in COS-1 cells, and the unusually short half-life of am T antigen in vivo. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that am T antigen had an intracellular half-life of approximately 10 min. In addition, although the am T antigen retained the major phosphorylation site found in simian virus 40 T antigen, it was not phosphorylated. Thus, phosphorylation of simian virus 40 T antigen is not required for the stimulation of host cell DNA synthesis. Finally, fusion of am404-infected monkey cells with Escherichia coli protoplasts containing appropriate procaryotic suppressor tRNAs showed that am404 is a suppressible nonsense mutation.</ab>

<ab>The site-directed bisulfite mutagenesis technique has been used to construct a specific mutation, am404, at nucleotide position 3124 in the simian virus 40 genome. The mutation was contained within a PstI restriction site (map position 0.27) and prevented cleavage by PstI at that position. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the mutagenized region indicated that only a single base pair change had occurred: a guanosine x cytosine leads to adenine x thymine transition. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of am404 with the known DNA sequence of simian virus 40 indicted that the mutation in am404 resulted in the conversion of a glutamine codon to an amber codon. am404 could not replicate autonomously when transfected into monkey cells (BSC-40) but did replicate when it was cotransfected with the late deletion helper virus dl1007. On the basis of its position in the T-antigen, gene am404 should produce a T-antigen 24% shorter than the wild-type protein.</ab>

<ab>The defective parvovirus Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is absolutely dependent upon coinfection with either Adenovirus or Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) for its multiplication. We have compared the terminal repeats of HSV-1F strain DNA with the terminal 200 nucleotides of AAV DNA. Our findings demonstrate similarities between portions of the HSV inverted repeats found at the L/S junction and the termini of AAV. By computer analysis we have determined potential secondary folding patterns for both genomes. The following points can be made about the a, b, and c repeats in HSV: (1) Regions b and c are complementary over a significant portion of their length. (2) The ends of a can fold back on themselves to form large secondary structures. Moreover, when the b and c homology is used to align the ends of a, the b/a and c/a junctions are within 1 base of each other. (3) The short direct repeats within a are essentially a large loop with little secondary structure. The potential implications of this structure are discussed and a model for HSV DNA replication is presented.</ab>

<ab>In vivo recombinant adeno-associated viral vector (rAAV)-mediated transduction of various tissues including brain has been characterized by slow onset and gradual increase in gene expression before reaching stable long-term protein levels. The early time course of transgene expression has not been quantified using newly available rAAV capsid serotypes. In this experiment, the onset of expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) after intrastriatal injection of rAAV2-based pseudotyped vectors (rAAV1, rAAV5, and rAAV8 capsids) was quantified. Native GFP fluorescence displayed a delayed onset of expression of at least 7 days for all the pseudotyped rAAV vectors. However, GFP immunohistochemical staining revealed significant transgene expression by 4 days after transduction for all serotypes and stable GFP(+) neuronal populations mediated by all serotypes within 14 days post transduction at the latest. rAAV2/1 and rAAV2/2 displayed no time-dependent increase of GFP(+) striatal neurons; reaching maximal striatal cell GFP(+) counts at 4 days after injection. All serotypes displayed peak transgene expression by 4 weeks post injection where native GFP(+) neurons were equal to immunostained striatal GFP(+) neurons. The inflammatory response to these rAAV vectors was present up to 4 weeks after transduction but was not apparent 9 months post injection. Thus, rAAV-mediated transgene expression begins earlier than previously thought.</ab>

<ab>We have used reciprocal competition binding experiments with mutant substrates and chemical modification interference assays to precisely define the sequences within the adeno-associated virus (AAV) terminal repeat (TR) that are involved in site-specific binding to the AAV Rep protein. Mutagenesis experiments were done with a 43-bp oligonucleotide which contained the Rep binding element (RBE) within the A stem of the TR. Experiments in which two adjacent base pairs of the RBE were substituted simultaneously with nucleotides that produced transversions identified a 22-bp sequence (CAGTGAGCGAGCGAGCGCGCAG) in which substitutions measurably affected the binding affinity. Although the 22-bp RBE contains the GAGC motifs that have been found in all known Rep binding sites, our results suggest that the GAGC motifs alone are not the only sequences specifically recognized by Rep. The effects of substitutions within the 22-bp sequence were relatively symmetrical, with nucleotides at the periphery of the RBE having the least effect on binding affinity and those in the middle having the greatest effect. Dinucleotide mutations within 18 (GTGAGCGAGCGAGC) of the 22 bp were found to decrease the binding affinity by at least threefold. Dinucleotide mutations within a 10-bp core sequence (GCGAGCGAGC) were found to decrease binding affinity by more than 10-fold. Single-base substitutions within the 10-bp core sequence lowered the binding affinity by variable amounts (up to fivefold). The results of the mutagenesis analysis suggested that the A-stem RBE contains only a single Rep binding site rather than two or more independent sites. To confirm the results of the mutant analysis and to determine the relative contribution of each base to binding, chemical modification experiments using dimethyl sulfate and hydrazine were performed on both the linear A-stem sequence and the entire AAV TR in both the flip and flop hairpinned configurations. Interference assays on the linear A stem identified the 18-bp sequence described above as essential for binding. G, C, and T residues on both strands contributed to binding, and the interference pattern correlated well with the results of the mutagenesis experiments. Interference assays with complete hairpinned TR substrates also identified the 18-bp sequence as important for binding. However, the interference patterns on the two strands within the RBE and the relative contributions of the individual bases to binding were clearly different between the hairpinned substrates and the linear A-stem binding element. Interference assays also allowed us to search for residues within the small internal palindromes of the TR (B and C) that contribute to binding. The largest effect was seen by modification of two T residues within the sequence CTTTG. This sequence was present in the same position relative to the terminal resolution site (trs) in both the flip and flop orientations of the TR. In addition, the interference pattern suggested that the remaining bases within the CTTTG motif as well as other bases within the B and C palindromes make contacts with the Rep protein, albeit with lower affinities. Regardless of whether the TR was in the flip or flop orientation, most of the contact points were clustered in the small internal palindrome furthest away from the trs. We also determined the relative binding affinity of linear substrates containing a complete RBE with hairpinned substrates and found that linear substrates bound Rep less efficiently. Our results were consistent with our previous model that there are three distinct elements within the hairpinned AAV TR that contribute to binding affinity or to efficient nicking at the trs: the A-stem RBE, the secondary structure element which consists of the B and C palindromes, and the trs.</ab>

<ab>We have cloned intact duplex adeno-associated virus (AAV) DNA into the bacterial plasmid pBR322. The AAV genome could be rescued from the recombinant plasmid by transfection of the plasmid DNA into human cells with adenovirus 5 as helper. The efficiency of rescue from the plasmid was sufficiently high to produce yields of AAV DNA comparable to those observed after transfection with equal amounts of purified virion DNA. Thus, the recombinant plasmid itself may be a model for studying the rescue of a latent AAV viral infection. In addition, the efficient rescue of viable AAV from the recombinant plasmid should facilitate the genetic analysis of AAV. Finally, the results of an analysis of the DNA from rescued virions indicate that an inversion of the AAV terminal sequences occurred during replication.</ab>

<ab>We have isolated three types of pBR322-AAV recombinant plasmids that contain deletions within the 145 bp AAV terminal repeats. When the plasmids were transfected into human cells, mutants that contained deletions within the left (type I) or right (type II) terminal repeat were viable. Of four mutants examined that contained deletions in both termini (type III), only one was viable. All of the viable mutants produced AAV virions that contained wild-type AAV DNA. Furthermore, the viable type III deletion could be converted to a nonviable mutant by deleting all copies of an 11 bp sequence from its termini. We conclude that there is an efficient mechanism for correcting deletions within the AAV termini. A model that could account for these observations is also discussed.</ab>

<ab>Mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (MPS VII) is caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucuronidase resulting in the accumulation of undegraded glycosaminoglycans in many tissues. A murine model of MPS VII shares many of the clinical, biochemical and histopathological features of human MPS VII and has provided an opportunity to study novel therapeutic approaches in a system with a uniform genetic background. Retroviral mediated gene therapy directed to the hematopoietic system or to artificial neo-organs resulted in low levels of enzyme in several tissues and reduced lysosomal storage in the liver and spleen. Partial correction of the disease in the eye was observed following an intravitreal injection of recombinant adenovirus. Neither retroviral nor adenoviral mediated gene transfer techniques resulted in a systemic reduction of lysosomal storage. Here we discuss several novel gene transfer approaches designed to increase the systemic levels of beta-glucuronidase in the MPS VII mouse.</ab>

<ab>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate whether sustained expression of mouse endostatin by adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene transfer can enhance the treatment efficacy of ionizing radiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mouse endostatin was cloned into recombinant AAV (rAAV) under the control of CMV beta-actin promoter. Recombinant mouse endostatin expressed via AAV gene transfer was tested for biological activity in endothelial cells. The impact of elevated serum levels of endostatin on tumor-induced angiogenesis was evaluated using an in vivo angiogenesis assay. The anti-tumor efficacy of combining rAAV-mediated endostatin delivery with radiation was evaluated in a human colorectal tumor model (HT29). RESULTS: Recombinant mouse endostatin expressed through an AAV vector (rAAV-mEndo) inhibited endothelial cell proliferation (by 40-45%) and migration (by 22-33%). Intramuscular injection of rAAV-mEndo (1x10(9) i.u.) led to a sustained serum endostatin level of approximately 500 ng/ml. Compared to control animals this endostatin level was sufficient to inhibit tumor cell-induced vessel formation (37 vs. 28.5, P&amp;lt;0.05) and delay the growth of HT29 xenografts (time from 200 to 1,000 mm(3), 21 vs. 34.5 days, P&amp;lt;0.05). When combined with ionizing radiation, elevated serum endostatin levels significantly enhanced the time for tumors to grow from 200 to 1,000 mm(3) (radiation, 34 days; endostatin plus radiation, 50 days, P&amp;lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: The delivery of endostatin via rAAV vectors may provide an effective means of enhancing the anti-tumor efficacy of radiation therapy.</ab>

<ab>A variety of approaches has demonstrated that interfering with tumor-induced angiogenesis may be an effective strategy in cancer therapy. However, it is likely that to be most effective such strategies will require extended suppression of the angiogenic process. Gene therapy offers a possible approach to achieve sustained release of a therapeutically potent transferred gene product. In the present study the angiogenesis inhibitor endostatin was expressed through a recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vector and shown to be biologically active in vitro and in vivo. Intramuscular injection of rAAV-HuEndo (1 x 10(9) i.u.) led to a sustained serum endostatin level of approximately 35-40 ng/mL. This endostatin level was sufficient to inhibit tumor cell-induced angiogenesis and to suppress both the initiation and subsequent growth of a human colorectal cancer model.</ab>

<ab>We have demonstrated that when the covalently joined ends of linear adeno-associated virus (AAV) DNA are resolved in vitro, the virus-encoded Rep protein becomes covalently attached to the 5&amp;#39; ends of the DNA. The covalent bond is between a tyrosine residue of the AAV Rep protein and a 5&amp;#39; phosphate of a thymidine residue in the AAV genome. Only the Rep protein encoded by the AAV p5 promoter, Rep68, was capable of becoming covalently attached to the ends of the AAV genome; the Rep proteins encoded by the p19 promoter were not. We also investigated some of the requirements for the complete in vitro resolution reaction. Inhibitor studies suggested that terminal resolution required DNA polymerase delta, ATP, and the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates but did not require the remaining ribonucleoside triphosphates, DNA polymerase alpha, RNA polymerase II, or topoisomerases I and II. Finally, purified AAV Rep68, when added to the crude cytosol from uninfected HeLa cells, was sufficient for resolution. This suggested that terminal resolution relies on host enzymes and the virus-encoded p5 Rep proteins.</ab>

<ab>We previously demonstrated that the adeno-associated virus (AAV) Rep68 and Rep78 proteins are able to nick the AAV origin of DNA replication at the terminal resolution site (trs) in an ATP-dependent manner. Using four types of modified or mutant substrates, we now have investigated the substrate requirements of Rep68 in the trs endonuclease reaction. In the first kind of substrate, portions of the hairpinned AAV terminal repeat were deleted. Only deletions that retained virtually all of the small internal palindromes of the AAV terminal repeat were active in the endonuclease reaction. This result confirmed previous genetic and biochemical evidence that the secondary structure of the terminal repeat was an important feature for substrate recognition. In the second type of substrate, the trs was moved eight bases further away from the end of the genome. The mutant was nicked at a 50-fold-lower frequency relative to a wild-type origin, and the nick occurred at the correct trs sequence despite its new position. This finding indicated that the endonuclease reaction required a specific sequence at the trs in addition to the correct secondary structure. It also suggested that the minimum trs recognition sequence extended three bases from the cut site in the 3&amp;#39; direction. The third type of substrate harbored mismatched base pairs at the trs. The mismatch substrates contained a wild-type sequence on the strand normally cut but an incorrect sequence on the complementary strand. All of the mismatch mutants were capable of being nicked in the presence of ATP. However, there was substantial variation in the level of activity, suggesting that the sequence on the opposite strand may also be recognized during nicking. Analysis of the mismatch mutants also suggested that a single-stranded trs was a viable substrate for the enzyme. This interpretation was confirmed by analysis of the fourth type of substrate tested, which contained a single-stranded trs. This substrate was also cleaved efficiently by the enzyme provided that the correct strand was present in the substrate. In addition, the single-stranded substrate no longer required ATP as a cofactor for nicking. Finally, all of the substrates with mutant trss bound the Rep protein as efficiently as the wild-type did. This finding indicated that the sequence at the cut site was not involved in recognition of the terminal repeat for specific binding by the enzyme. We concluded that substrate recognition by the AAV Rep protein involves at least two and possibly as many as four features of the AAV terminal repeat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</ab>

<ab>We have developed an assay for a key step in the replication of adeno-associated virus (AAV) DNA. We demonstrate the covalently joined ends of linear AAV DNA can be resolved in vitro to the open duplex configuration. Only extracts prepared from human cells that have been infected with both adenovirus and AAV are capable of carrying out the reaction. The reaction is initiated by a site-specific and strand-specific endonucleolytic cut at a terminal resolution site near the end of the AAV terminal palindrome. During resolution the orientation of the terminal palindrome is inverted, and the 3&amp;#39; viral strand is extended by DNA synthesis. The size of the newly synthesized 3&amp;#39; strand is nearly identical to that found in viral particles. These observations provide direct biochemical evidence for an essential step in the model for AAV DNA replication.</ab>

<ab>Recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors have been used to transduce murine skeletal muscle as a platform for secretion of therapeutic proteins. The utility of this approach for treating alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency was tested in murine myocytes in vitro and in vivo. AAV vectors expressing the human AAT gene from either the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (AAV-C-AT) or the human elongation factor 1-alpha promoter (AAV-E-AT) were examined. In vitro in C2C12 murine myoblasts, the expression levels in transient transfections were similar between the two vectors. One month after transduction, however, the human elongation factor 1 promoter mediated 10-fold higher stable human AAT expression than the CMV promoter. In vivo transduction was performed by injecting doses of up to 1.4 x 10(13) particles into skeletal muscles of several mouse strains (C57BL/6, BALB/c, and SCID). In vivo, the CMV vector mediated higher levels of expression, with sustained serum levels over 800 micrograms/ml in SCID and over 400 micrograms/ml in C57BL/6 mice. These serum concentrations are 100,000-fold higher than those previously observed with AAV vectors in muscle and are at levels which would be therapeutic if achieved in humans. High level expression was delayed for several weeks but was sustained for over 15 wk. Immune responses were dependent upon the mouse strain and the vector dosage. These data suggest that recombinant AAV vector transduction of skeletal muscle could provide a means for replacing AAT or other essential serum proteins but that immune responses may be elicited under certain conditions.</ab>

<ab>BACKGROUND: Recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors serotype 2 (rAAV2) can transduce several tissues with high efficiency. Materials and Methods: The transduction efficiency of rAAV2 in pancreatic and colon cancer was compared to that of recombinant adenovirus (rAd) in vitro and in vivo using green fluorescent protein (GFP). RESULTS: With the exception of SU.86.86, the percentage of GFP-positive cells was below 10% at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 for rAAV2. At the same MOI, almost 100% of cells expressed GFP when rAd was used. However, the transduction efficiency for rAA V2 was comparable to that of rAd when coinfected with wt adenovirus, leading to a dramatic increase in the amount of double-stranded rAAV2 DNA. Similar results were obtained in vivo. While widespread GFP expression was readily detected in all xenografts injected with rAd, only one section of all tumors injected with rAAV2 contained GFP-positive cells. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that rAAV2 might be useful for an ex vivo approach in cancer gene therapy, but it does not seem to be feasible for the in vivo treatment of malignant tumors.</ab>

<ab>BACKGROUND: Silencing of the viral CMV immediate early enhancer promoter can be a problem in certain cell types when engineering stable cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared the efficacy of the CMV promoter to the promoter of the elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1 alpha) for the generation of stable colon carcinoma cell lines (HT-29). Green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression cassettes were delivered by recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) which is known for its ability to stably transduce cells. Stable cell lines were characterized in vitro by FACS and in vivo after HT-29 clones were grown as xenografts in nude mice. RESULTS: Stable HT-29 clones with &amp;gt; 97% of all cells homogeneously expressing GFP were generated with the EF-1 alpha promoter. In contrast in clones carrying the CMV promoter, only up to 60% of the cells were GFP-positive with expression levels varying widely between cells. Superinfection with wild-type adenovirus induced GFP expression in more than 90% of the cells indicating that the CMV promoter was silenced. In vivo the tumors carrying the EF-1 alpha promoter were homogeneously GFP-positive, whereas the CMV promoter gave rise to a scattered pattern of GFP expression. CONCLUSION: This study underlines the importance of the promoter for the generation of stable cell lines. In addition it demonstrates that recombinant AAV can effectively be used as a gene delivery system for this purpose.</ab>

<ab>Intraventricular delivery of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) results in weight loss. We hypothesized that this effect of GDNF was likely mediated via its effects on dopaminergic neurons in the hypothalamus. Continuous rAAV-mediated GDNF expression in the hypothalamus of young and senescent rats resulted in weight loss compared to controls. However, GDNF-induced weight loss was unrelated to alterations in hypothalamic dopamine levels. The weight loss was associated with decreased food intake and increased energy expenditure, but these effects were not mediated by changes in hypothalamic NPY or POMC expression. Moreover, uncoupling protein 1 levels were unchanged in brown adipose tissue (BAT). The reduction in weight and adiposity were as great or greater in the aged rats even though aged rats are generally resistant to weight loss therapies. In summary, central GDNF gene delivery reduces weight and adiposity in young and aged rats through decreased food intake and increased energy expenditure. Our observations in aged rats suggest that GDNF may be especially effective in reducing obesity in aged obese rats.</ab>

<ab>Spinal cord injury (SCI) induces a progressive pathophysiology affecting cell survival and neurological integrity via complex and evolving molecular cascades whose interrelationships are not fully understood. The present experiments were designed to: (1) determine potential functional interactions within transcriptional expression profiles obtained after a clinically relevant SCI and (2) test the consistency of transcript expression after SCI in two genetically and immunologically diverse rat strains characterized by differences in T cell competence and associated inflammatory responses. By interrogating Affymetrix U34A rat genome GeneChip microarrays, we defined the transcriptional expression patterns in midcervical contusion lesion sites between 1 and 90 d postinjury of athymic nude (AN) and Sprague Dawley (SD) strains. Stringent statistical analyses detected significant changes in 3638 probe sets, with 80 genes differing between the AN and SD groups. Subsequent detailed functional categorization of these transcripts unveiled an overall tissue remodeling response that was common to both strains. The functionally organized gene profiles were temporally distinct and correlated with repair indices observed microscopically and by magnetic resonance microimaging. Our molecular and anatomical observations have identified a novel, longitudinal perspective of the post-SCI response, namely, that of a highly orchestrated tissue repair and remodeling repertoire with a prominent cutaneous wound healing signature that is conserved between two widely differing rat strains. These results have significant bearing on the continuing development of cellular and pharmacological therapeutics directed at tissue rescue and neuronal regeneration in the injured spinal cord.</ab>

<ab>Direct insertion of amino acid sequences into the adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV) capsid open reading frame (cap ORF) is one strategy currently being developed for retargeting this prototypical gene therapy vector. While this approach has successfully resulted in the formation of AAV particles that have expanded or retargeted viral tropism, the inserted sequences have been relatively short, linear receptor binding ligands. Since many receptor-ligand interactions involve nonlinear, conformation-dependent binding domains, we investigated the insertion of full-length peptides into the AAV cap ORF. To minimize disruption of critical VP3 structural domains, we confined the insertions to residue 138 within the VP1-VP2 overlap, which has been shown to be on the surface of the particle following insertion of smaller epitopes. The insertion of coding sequences for the 8-kDa chemokine binding domain of rat fractalkine (CX3CL1), the 18-kDa human hormone leptin, and the 30-kDa green fluorescent protein (GFP) after residue 138 failed to lead to formation of particles due to the loss of VP3 expression. To test the ability to complement these insertions with the missing capsid proteins in trans, we designed a system for producing AAV vectors in which expression of one capsid protein is isolated and combined with the remaining two capsid proteins expressed separately. Such an approach allows for genetic modification of a specific capsid protein across its entire coding sequence leaving the remaining capsid proteins unaffected. An examination of particle formation from the individual components of the system revealed that genome-containing particles formed as long as the VP3 capsid protein was present and demonstrated that the VP2 capsid protein is nonessential for viral infectivity. Viable particles composed of all three capsid proteins were obtained from the capsid complementation groups regardless of which capsid proteins were supplied separately in trans. Significant overexpression of VP2 resulted in the formation of particles with altered capsid protein stoichiometry. The key finding was that by using this system we successfully obtained nearly wild-type levels of recombinant AAV-like particles with large ligands inserted after residue 138 in VP1 and VP2 or in VP2 exclusively. While insertions at residue 138 in VP1 significantly decreased infectivity, insertions at residue 138 that were exclusively in VP2 had a minimal effect on viral assembly or infectivity. Finally, insertion of GFP into VP1 and VP2 resulted in a particle whose trafficking could be temporally monitored by using confocal microscopy. Thus, we have demonstrated a method that can be used to insert large (up to 30-kDa) peptide ligands into the AAV particle. This system allows greater flexibility than current approaches in genetically manipulating the composition of the AAV particle and, in particular, may allow vector retargeting to alternative receptors requiring interaction with full-length conformation-dependent peptide ligands.</ab>

<ab>PURPOSE: One enzyme/prodrug combination that has the potential to be used in virally directed enzyme/prodrug therapy (VDEPT) is the obligate 2-electron reducing enzyme, DT-diaphorase (NQO1), with bioreductive agents such as EO9. The present studies were undertaken to determine if this enzyme, as well as the reporter molecule, green fluorescent protein (GFP), could be expressed from a single dicistronic unit under control of the CMV promoter in an adeno-associated virus (AAV) background. METHODS: The human ovarian tumor cell line, SAU, and the mouse sarcoma cell line, KHT/iv, were studied due to their low level of NQO1 expression. These cells were transfected with pTRUF3-NQO1 using a liposome-mediated protocol. RESULTS: The results indicate that this construct has the ability to increase the total protein level of NQO1 by 66-fold in SAU and 102-fold in KHT/iv after 24 h. Furthermore, the level of NQO1 activity in SAU increased from undetectable levels to approximately 200 nmol/min/mg, and the NQO1 activity in KHT/iv increased approximately 10-fold following transfection. Expression of the GFP reporter was readily detectable in both cell types using FACS analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results indicate that this proviral AAV vector plasmid will allow for the production of a recombinant AAV, which can coordinately express the enzyme NQO1 and the GFP reporter for use in vivo in VDEPT studies with various bioreductive agents which are substrates for NQO1.</ab>

<ab>Adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV2) has proven to be a valuable vector for gene therapy. Characterization of the functional domains of the AAV capsid proteins can facilitate our understanding of viral tissue tropism, immunoreactivity, viral entry, and DNA packaging, all of which are important issues for generating improved vectors. To obtain a comprehensive genetic map of the AAV capsid gene, we have constructed 93 mutants at 59 different positions in the AAV capsid gene by site-directed mutagenesis. Several types of mutants were studied, including epitope tag or ligand insertion mutants, alanine scanning mutants, and epitope substitution mutants. Analysis of these mutants revealed eight separate phenotypes. Infectious titers of the mutants revealed four classes. Class 1 mutants were viable, class 2 mutants were partially defective, class 3 mutants were temperature sensitive, and class 4 mutants were noninfectious. Further analysis revealed some of the defects in the class 2, 3, and 4 mutants. Among the class 4 mutants, a subset completely abolished capsid formation. These mutants were located predominantly, but not exclusively, in what are likely to be beta-barrel structures in the capsid protein VP3. Two of these mutants were insertions at the N and C termini of VP3, suggesting that both ends of VP3 play a role that is important for capsid assembly or stability. Several class 2 and 3 mutants produced capsids that were unstable during purification of viral particles. One mutant, R432A, made only empty capsids, presumably due to a defect in packaging viral DNA. Additionally, five mutants were defective in heparan binding, a step that is believed to be essential for viral entry. These were distributed into two amino acid clusters in what is likely to be a cell surface loop in the capsid protein VP3. The first cluster spanned amino acids 509 to 522; the second was between amino acids 561 and 591. In addition to the heparan binding clusters, hemagglutinin epitope tag insertions identified several other regions that were on the surface of the capsid. These included insertions at amino acids 1, 34, 138, 266, 447, 591, and 664. Positions 1 and 138 were the N termini of VP1 and VP2, respectively; position 34 was exclusively in VP1; the remaining surface positions were located in putative loop regions of VP3. The remaining mutants, most of them partially defective, were presumably defective in steps of viral entry that were not tested in the preliminary screening, including intracellular trafficking, viral uncoating, or coreceptor binding. Finally, in vitro experiments showed that insertion of the serpin receptor ligand in the N-terminal regions of VP1 or VP2 can change the tropism of AAV. Our results provide information on AAV capsid functional domains and are useful for future design of AAV vectors for targeting of specific tissues.</ab>

<ab>We examined cytoplasmic trafficking and nuclear translocation of adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV) by using Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated wild-type AAV, A20 monoclonal antibody immunocytochemistry, and subcellular fractionation techniques followed by DNA hybridization. Our results indicated that in the absence of adenovirus (Ad), AAV enters the cell rapidly and escapes from early endosomes with a t(1/2) of about 10 min postinfection. Cytoplasmically distributed AAV accumulated around the nucleus and persisted perinuclearly for 16 to 24 h. Viral uncoating occurred before or during nuclear entry beginning about 12 h postinfection, when viral protein and DNA were readily detected in the nucleus. Few, if any, intact AAV capsids were found in the nucleus. In the presence of Ad, however, cytoplasmic AAV quickly translocated into the nucleus as intact particles as early as 40 min after coinfection, and this facilitated nuclear translocation of AAV was not blocked by the nuclear pore complex inhibitor thapsigargan. The rapid nuclear translocation of intact AAV capsids in the presence of Ad suggested that one or more Ad capsid proteins might be altering trafficking. Indeed, coinfection with empty Ad capsids also resulted in the appearance of AAV DNA in nuclei within 40 min. Escape from early endosomes did not seem to be affected by Ad coinfection.</ab>

<ab>We have documented that epidermal growth factor receptor protein tyrosine kinase (EGFR-PTK) signaling negatively affects intracellular trafficking and transduction efficiency of recombinant adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) vectors. Specifically, inhibition of EGFR-PTK signaling leads to decreased ubiquitination of AAV2 capsid proteins, which in turn, facilitates viral nuclear transport by limiting proteasome-mediated degradation of AAV2 vectors. In the present studies, we observed that AAV capsids can indeed be phosphorylated at tyrosine residues by EGFR-PTK in in vitro phosphorylation assays and that phosphorylated AAV capsids retain their structural integrity. However, although phosphorylated AAV vectors enter cells as efficiently as their unphosphorylated counterparts, their transduction efficiency is significantly reduced. This reduction is not due to impaired viral second-strand DNA synthesis since transduction efficiency of both single-stranded AAV (ssAAV) and self-complementary AAV (scAAV) vectors is decreased by approximately 68% and approximately 74%, respectively. We also observed that intracellular trafficking of tyrosine-phosphorylated AAV vectors from cytoplasm to nucleus is significantly decreased, which results from ubiquitination of AAV capsids followed by proteasome-mediated degradation, although downstream consequences of capsid ubiquitination may also be affected by tyrosine-phosphorylation. These studies provide new insights into the role of tyrosine-phosphorylation of AAV capsids in various steps in the virus life cycle, which has implications in the optimal use of recombinant AAV vectors in human gene therapy.</ab>

<ab>Recombinant adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) vectors are in use in several Phase I/II clinical trials, but relatively large vector doses are needed to achieve therapeutic benefits. Large vector doses also trigger an immune response as a significant fraction of the vectors fails to traffic efficiently to the nucleus and is targeted for degradation by the host cell proteasome machinery. We have reported that epidermal growth factor receptor protein tyrosine kinase (EGFR-PTK) signaling negatively affects transduction by AAV2 vectors by impairing nuclear transport of the vectors. We have also observed that EGFR-PTK can phosphorylate AAV2 capsids at tyrosine residues. Tyrosine-phosphorylated AAV2 vectors enter cells efficiently but fail to transduce effectively, in part because of ubiquitination of AAV capsids followed by proteasome-mediated degradation. We reasoned that mutations of the surface-exposed tyrosine residues might allow the vectors to evade phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination and, thus, prevent proteasome-mediated degradation. Here, we document that site-directed mutagenesis of surface-exposed tyrosine residues leads to production of vectors that transduce HeLa cells approximately 10-fold more efficiently in vitro and murine hepatocytes nearly 30-fold more efficiently in vivo at a log lower vector dose. Therapeutic levels of human Factor IX (F.IX) are also produced at an approximately 10-fold reduced vector dose. The increased transduction efficiency of tyrosine-mutant vectors is due to lack of capsid ubiquitination and improved intracellular trafficking to the nucleus. These studies have led to the development of AAV vectors that are capable of high-efficiency transduction at lower doses, which has important implications in their use in human gene therapy.</ab>

<ab>We have developed an in vitro procedure for packaging of recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV). By using AAV replicative-form DNA as the substrate, it is possible to synthesize an infectious AAV particle in vitro that can be used to transfer a marker gene to mammalian cells. The packaging procedure requires the presence of both the AAV Rep and capsid proteins. Two kinds of in vitro products can be formed which facilitate DNA transfer. Both are resistant to heat and have a density in cesium chloride gradients that is indistinguishable from that of the in vivo-synthesized wild-type virus. This indicates that the particles formed have the appropriate protein-to-DNA ratio and a structure that shares the heat resistance of mature AAV particles. The two types of particles can be distinguished by their sensitivity to chloroform and DNase I treatment. The chloroform-resistant product is, by several criteria, an authentic AAV particle. In addition to having the correct density and being resistant to treatment with chloroform, DNase I, and heat, this particle is efficiently synthesized only if the AAV genome contains intact terminal repeats, which are known to be required for AAV packaging. It is also precipitated by a monoclonal antibody that recognizes mature virus particles but not bound by an antibody that recognizes monomeric or denatured capsid proteins. The chloroform-resistant species is not made when aphidicolin is present in the reaction mixture, suggesting that active DNA replication is required for in vitro packaging. In contrast, the chloroform-sensitive product has several features that suggest it is an incompletely assembled virus particle. It is sensitive to DNase I, does not require the presence of AAV terminal repeats, and is capable of transferring DNA that is theoretically too large to package. Sucrose gradient centrifugation of the in vitro-synthesized products reveals that the particles have sedimentation values between 60S and 110S, which is consistent with partially assembled and mature AAV particles. The in vitro packaging procedure should be useful for studying the mechanism by which a human icosahedral DNA virus particle is assembled, and it may be useful for producing recombinant AAV for gene therapy. The chloroform-sensitive particle may also be useful for transferring DNA that is too large to be packaged in mature recombinant AAV.</ab>

<ab>The adeno-associated virus (AAV) nonstructural proteins Rep68 and Rep78 are site-specific DNA binding proteins, ATP-dependent site-specific endonucleases, helicases, and ATPases. These biochemical activities are required for viral DNA replication and control of viral gene expression. In this study, we characterized the biochemical properties of the helicase and ATPase activities of homogeneously pure Rep68. The enzyme exists as a monomer in solution at the concentrations used in this study ( CTP = dATP &amp;gt; UTP &amp;gt; dGTP. The Km values for ATP in both the DNA helicase reaction and the site-specific trs endonuclease reaction were essentially the same, approximately 180 microM. Both reactions were sigmoidal with respect to ATP concentration, suggesting that a dimer or higher-order multimer of Rep68 is necessary for both DNA helicase activity and terminal resolution site (trs) nicking activity. Furthermore, when the enzyme itself was titrated in the trs endonuclease and ATPase reactions, both activities were second order with respect to enzyme concentration. This suggests that a dimer of Rep68 is the active form for both the ATPase and nicking activities. In contrast, DNA helicase activity was linear with respect to enzyme concentration. When bound to ssDNA, the enzyme unwound the DNA in the 3&amp;#39;-to-5&amp;#39; direction. DNA unwinding occurred at a rate of approximately 345 bp per min per monomeric enzyme molecule. The ATP turnover rate was approximately 30 to 50 ATP molecules per min per enzyme molecule. Surprisingly, the presence of DNA was not required for ATPase activity. We estimated that Rep translocates processively for more than 1,300 bases before dissociating from its substrate in the absence of any accessory proteins. DNA helicase activity was not significantly stimulated by substrates that have the structure of a replication fork and contain either a 5&amp;#39; or 3&amp;#39; tail. Rep68 binds only to ssDNA, as judged by inhibition of the DNA helicase reaction with ss or double-stranded (ds) DNA. Consistent with this observation, no helicase activity was detected on blunt-ended ds oligonucleotide substrates unless they also contained an ss 3&amp;#39; tail. However, if a blunt-ended ds oligonucleotide contained the 22-bp Rep binding element sequence, Rep68 was capable of unwinding the substrate. This means that Rep68 can function both as a conventional helicase for strand displacement synthesis and as a terminal-repeat-unwinding protein which catalyzes the conversion of a duplex end to a hairpin primer. Thus, the properties of the Rep DNA helicase activity suggest that Rep is involved in all three of the key steps in AAV DNA replication: terminal resolution, reinitiation, and strand displacement.</ab>

<ab>Conventional methods for rAAV purification that are based on cesium chloride ultracentrifugation have often produced vector preparations of variable quality and resulted in significant loss of particle infectivity. We report here several novel purification strategies that involve the use of non-ionic iodixanol gradients followed by ion exchange or heparin affinity chromatography by either conventional or HPLC columns. These methods result in more than 50% recovery of rAAV from a crude lysate and routinely produce vector that is more than 99% pure. More importantly, the new purification procedures consistently produce rAAV stocks with particle-to-infectivity ratios of less than 100, which is significantly better than conventional methods. The new protocol increases the overall yield of infectious rAAV by at least 10-fold and allows for the complete purification of rAAV in 1 working day. Several of these methods should also be useful for large-scale production.</ab>

<ab>We constructed gfph, a synthetic version of the jellyfish Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (gfp) cDNA that is adapted for high-level expression in mammalian cells, especially those of human origin. A total of 92 base substitutions were made in 88 codons in order to change the codon usage within the gfp10 coding sequence so that it was more appropriate for expression in mammalian cells. We also describe a series of versatile recombinant adeno-associated virus and adenovirus vectors for delivery and expression of genes into mammalian cells and, using these vectors, demonstrate the efficient transduction and expression of the gfph gene in the human cell line 293 and also in vivo, within neurosensory cells of guinea pig eye. Cells infected with recombinant adeno-associated virus-GFPH can be readily sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, suggesting that the newly designed gfph gene could be widely used as a reporter in many gene delivery technologies, including human gene therapy.</ab>

<ab>Recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vectors based on serotype 2 are currently being evaluated most extensively in animals and human clinical trials. rAAV vectors constructed from other AAV serotypes (serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6) can transduce certain tissues more efficiently and with different specificity than rAAV2 vectors in animal models. Here, we describe reagents and methods for the production and purification of AAV2 inverted terminal repeat-containing vectors pseudotyped with AAV1 or AAV5 capsids. To facilitate pseudotyping, AAV2rep/AAV1cap and AAV2rep/AAV5cap helper plasmids were constructed in an adenoviral plasmid backbone. The resultant plasmids, pXYZ1 and pXYZ5, were used to produce rAAV1 and rAAV5 vectors, respectively, by transient transfection. Since neither AAV5 nor AAV1 binds to the heparin affinity chromatography resin used to purify rAAV2 vectors, purification protocols were developed based on anion-exchange chromatography. The purified vector stocks are 99% pure with titers of 1 x 10(12) to 1 x 10(13)vector genomes/ml.</ab>
