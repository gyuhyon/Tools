<ab>Deletion of the M063 gene from myxoma virus produces a virus that is unable to replicate in rabbit cells in vitro or in live rabbits but can be propagated in non-rabbit cell lines. A targeted M063 deletion mutant was constructed in the attenuated Uriarra strain of myxoma virus and the ability of this virus to act as a safe, non-transmissible vaccine against myxomatosis was tested in outbred laboratory rabbits. Immunization with the M063 deletion vaccine provided good short-term protection against lethal challenge with virulent myxoma virus. Long-term protection was similar to reported results with heterologous live virus, with some rabbits protected but others succumbing to challenge. Replication-deficient poxvirus vaccines, like the Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara (MVA) in man and the myxoma virus vaccine described here in rabbits, are very attractive from a safety perspective. Seasonal boosting would be predicted to provide long-term protection. Targeted host-range gene deletions could have potential for rapid development of poxvirus vaccines in general.</ab>

<ab>The authors have recently demonstrated that wild-type myxoma virus (MV) tagged with gfp (vMyxgfp) can generate a tumor-specific infection that productively infects and clears human tumor-derived xenografts when injected intratumorally into human gliomas transplanted into immunodeficient mice (Lun et al, 2005). To expand the understanding of MV tropism in cancer cells from a specific tissue lineage, the authors have screened a series of human glioma cells (U87, U118, U251, U343, U373) for myxoma virus replication and oncolysis. To assess the viral tropism determinants for these infections, the authors have screened myxoma virus knockout constructs that have been deleted for specific host range genes (M-T2, M-T4, M-T5, M11L, and M063), as well as a control MV gene knockout construct with no known host range function (vMyx135KO) but is highly attenuated in rabbits. The authors report wide variation in the ability of various vMyx-hrKOs to replicate and spread in the human glioma cells as measured by early and late viral gene expression. This differential ability to support vMyx-hrKO productive viral replication is consistent with levels of endogenous activated Akt in the various gliomas. The authors have identified one vMyx-hrKO virus (vMyx63KO) and one nonhost range knockout construct (vMyx135KO) that appear to replicate in the gliomas even more efficiently than the wild-type virus and that reduce the viability of the infected gliomas. These knockout viruses also inhibit the proliferation of gliomas in a manner similar to the wild-type virus. Together these data, as well as the fact that these knockout viruses are attenuated in their natural hosts, may represent environmentally safer candidate oncolytic viruses for usage in human trials.</ab>

<ab>Poxviruses collectively encode an impressive collection of diverse immunomodulatory proteins. In this review we draw attention to some of the new open reading frames (ORFs) discovered during the sequencing of the myxoma virus DNA genome [Cameron C, Hota-Mitchell S, Chen L, Barrett J, Cao J-X, Macaulay C, Willer D, Evans D, McFadden G (1999) The complete DNA sequence of myxoma virus. Virology 264:298-318] that may function to subvert the host immune system. Most of these predicted functions are speculative but some of the deduced primary amino acid sequences contain intriguing similarities to known cellular and viral proteins in the public domain for which immunomodulatory functions have been assigned.</ab>

<ab>The myxoma virus M063R gene product exhibits some sequence similarity to the poxvirus host range gene, C7L, of vaccinia virus. To address the potential host range function of the M063R gene product in rabbits, a deletion mutant of myxoma virus (vMyx63KO) was generated and characterized. vMyx63KO replicated to normal titre levels and produced foci that were indistinguishable from those produced by MV in vitro in a monkey kidney cell line (BGMK) that are permissive for wild type MV. However, vMyx63KO failed to replicate in all rabbit cell lines tested, including both primary and established cells lines, as well as cells derived from a variety of tissues. M063R expression was not required for myxoma virus binding, entry or early gene expression, whereas DNA replication was aborted and late genes were not expressed in vMyx63KO infected rabbit cells. Thus, the replication block for vMyx63KO in rabbit cells preceded the stage of late gene expression and DNA replication. Finally, an in vivo pathogenesis study indicated that vMyx63KO failed to cause any signs of classic myxomatosis in infected rabbits, but functioned as a non-replicating vaccine and provided protection for subsequent challenge by wild type myxoma virus. Altogether, these observations demonstrate that M063R plays a critical role in determining the host specificity of myxoma virus in rabbit cells.</ab>

<ab>Transient expression of viral genes from certain poxviruses in uninfected mammalian cells can sometimes be unexpectedly inefficient. The reasons for poor expression levels can be due to a number of features of the gene cassette, such as cryptic splice sites, polymerase II termination sequences or motifs that lead to mRNA instability. Here we suggest that in some cases the problem of low protein expression in transfected mammalian cells may be due to inefficient codon usage. We have observed that for many poxvirus genes from the yatapoxvirus genus this deficiency can be overcome by synthesis of the gene with codon sequences optimized for expression in primate cells. This led us to examine colon usage across 2-dozen sequenced members of the Poxviridae. We conclude that codon usage is surprisingly divergent across the different Poxviridae genera but is much more conserved within a single genus. Thus, Poxviridae genera can be divided into distinct groups based on their observed codon bias. When viewed in this context, successful transient expression of transfected poxvirus genes in uninfected mammalian cells can be more accurately predicted based on codon bias. As a corollary, for specific poxvirus genes with less favorable codon usage, codon optimization can result in profoundly increased transient expression levels following transfection of uninfected mammalian cell lines.</ab>

<ab>Myxoma virus (MV) encodes a cell surface protein (M135R) that is predicted to mimic the host alpha/beta interferon receptor (IFN-alpha/beta-R) and thus prevent IFN-alpha/beta from triggering a host antiviral response. This prediction is based on sequence similarity to B18R, the viral IFN-alpha/beta-R from vaccinia virus (VV), which has been demonstrated to bind and inhibit type I interferons. However, M135R is only half the size of VV B18R. All other poxvirus-encoded IFN-alpha/beta-R homologs align only to the amino-terminal half of M135R. Peptide antibodies raised against M135R were used for immunoblotting and immunofluorescence and indicate that M135R is expressed as an early gene and that the product is a cell surface N-linked glycoprotein that is not secreted. In contrast to the predicted properties of M135R as an inhibitor of type I interferon, all binding and inhibition assays designed to demonstrate whether M135R can interact with IFN-alpha/beta have been negative. However, pathogenesis studies with a targeted M135-knockout MV construct (vMyx135KO) indicate that the deletion of M135R severely attenuates MV pathogenesis in the European rabbit. We propose that M135R is an important immunomodulatory virulence factor for myxomatosis but that the target immune ligand is not from the predicted type I interferon family and remains to be identified.</ab>

<ab>Myxoma virus (MV) is a highly lethal, rabbit-specific poxvirus that induces a disease called myxomatosis in European rabbits. In an effort to understand the function of predicted immunomodulatory genes we have deleted various viral genes from MV and tested the ability of these knockout viruses to induce lethal myxomatosis. MV encodes a unique 15 kD cytoplasmic protein (M130R) that is expressed late (12h post infection) during infection. M130R is a non-essential gene for MV replication in rabbit, monkey or human cell lines. Construction of a targeted gene knockout virus (vMyx130KO) and infection of susceptible rabbits demonstrate that the M130R knockout virus is attenuated and that loss of M130R expression allows the rabbit host immune system to effectively respond to and control the lethal effects of MV. M130R expression is a bona fide poxviral virulence factor necessary for full and lethal development of myxomatosis.</ab>

<ab>To investigate the contribution of the myxoma virus M-T4 gene to viral virulence, both copies of the M-T4 gene were inactivated by disruption and insertion of the Escherichia coli guanosine phosphoribosyltransferase gene. Infection of European rabbits with the recombinant M-T4-deleted virus, vMyxlacT4, resulted in disease attenuation. In contrast, infection of rabbits with vMyxlac elicited the classical features of lethal myxomatosis. A notable decrease in the number of secondary lesions in animals infected with vMyxlacT4 suggested an inability of the virus to disseminate in vivo. Infection of either a rabbit CD4+ T cell line, RL-5, or primary rabbit peripheral blood lymphocytes with vMyxlacT4- resulted in the rapid induction of apoptosis. Sequence analysis of M-T4 revealed both an N-terminal signal sequence and a C-terminal -RDEL sequence, suggesting that M-T4 resides in the endoplasmic reticulum. The M-T4 protein was found to be sensitive to endo H digestion and confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that M-T4 colocalized with calreticulin, indicating that M-T4 is retained within the endoplasmic reticulum. Our results indicate that M-T4 is the first example of an intracellular virulence factor in myxoma virus that functions from within the endoplasmic reticulum and is necessary for the productive infection of lymphocytes.</ab>

<ab>Myxoma virus is a pathogenic poxvirus that induces extensive dysregulation of cellular immunity in infected European rabbits. Infection of a rabbit CD4+ T-cell line (RL-5) with myxoma virus results in dramatic reductions of cell surface levels of CD4 as monitored by flow cytometry. The virus-induced downregulation of CD4 requires early but not late viral gene expression and could not be inhibited by staurosporine, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, which effectively blocks phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate-induced downregulation of CD4. The decrease in total cellular levels of CD4 during myxoma virus infection could be inhibited by the lysosomotrophic agent NH4Cl, suggesting a lysosomal fate for CD4 during myxoma virus infection. Steady-state levels of the CD4-associated protein tyrosine kinase p56lck remained unchanged during myxoma virus infection, suggesting that p56lck dissociates from CD4 prior to CD4 degradation in virus infected cells. Total p56lck kinase activity was unaffected during myxoma virus infection, although the amount of p56lck physically associated with CD4 declined in parallel with the loss of CD4. Thus, myxoma virus infection of CD4+ T lymphocytes triggers CD4 downregulation via a protein kinase C-independent pathway, causing the dissociation of p56lck and the degradation of CD4 in lysosomal vesicles.</ab>

<ab>In order to replicate efficiently within the host, viruses have evolved multiple strategies to evade the host&amp;#39;s immune system. In many cases viruses have actually hijacked various components of the host&amp;#39;s immune system to ensure their own survival. One such strategy is the expression of virus encoded cytokines and cytokine receptors. Members of the poxvirus and herpesvirus families have been particularly successful with this strategy. The study of virus survival strategies provides important information regarding both virus biology as well as information about the immune system itself.</ab>

<ab>Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and the members of the interferon (IFN) family are major inducible cytokines that function to counteract viral infections or cellular transformation. Recently, our lab has characterized a novel antiviral state which is induced in primary human fibroblasts by co-treatment with TNF plus IFNbeta. Here, we demonstrate that this synergistic state is both antiviral and cytostatic for primary human cells. Significantly, we observed that a wide spectrum of transformed human cancer cells have universally lost the ability to induce the TNF/IFNbeta synergistic state, as defined by three separate criteria. We hypothesize that the ability to induce the TNF/IFNbeta synergistic state is a unique feature of primary cells and is incompatible with cellular immortalization and/or transformation.</ab>

<ab>Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and members of the interferon (IFN) family have been shown to independently inhibit the replication of a variety of viruses. In addition, previous reports have shown that treatment with various combinations of these antiviral cytokines induces a synergistic antiviral state that can be significantly more potent than addition of any of these cytokines alone. The mechanism of this cytokine synergy and its effects on global gene expression, however, are not well characterized. Here, we use DNA microarray analysis to demonstrate that treatment of uninfected primary human fibroblasts with TNF plus IFN-beta induces a distinct synergistic state characterized by significant perturbations of several hundred genes which are coinduced by the individual cytokines alone, as well as the induction of more than 850 novel host cell genes. This synergy is mediated directly by the two ligands, not by intermediate secreted factors, and is necessary and sufficient to completely block the productive replication and spread of myxoma virus in human fibroblasts. In contrast, the replication of two other poxviruses, vaccinia virus and tanapox virus, are only partially inhibited in these cells by the synergistic antiviral state, whereas the spread of both of these viruses to neighboring cells was efficiently blocked. Taken together, our data indicate that the combination of TNF and IFN-beta induces a novel synergistic antiviral state that is highly distinct from that induced by either cytokine alone.</ab>

<ab>Individually, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and the various interferons frequently display strong antiviral activities. Certain combinations of these cytokines, however, induce a synergistic antiviral state which is distinct from that induced by either one alone. This novel synergistic antiviral state likely occurs through several possible mechanisms, involves multiple signaling pathways, and inhibits a wider range of viruses than the individual cytokines alone. While underappreciated when first discovered, this synergistic phenomenon is proving to be of a much broader scope than initially thought. More work is needed to refine our understanding of this observation and its physiological implications for anti-pathogen responses.</ab>

<ab>Chemokines are important for activation of a host of cellular immune and inflammatory responses including cell signaling, activation, and communication. M-T7, a myxoma virus protein, inhibits the activity of chemokines by direct binding to chemokines and/or with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). To study the effects of this chemokine-modulating protein (CMP), we use a variety of in vitro and in vivo techniques to evaluate M-T7 inhibition of inflammatory cells. To quickly analyze the effects of M-T7, changes in cell adhesion and membrane fluidity are measured as well as cell migration in mouse ascites. For more physiological analyses, an aortic transplant model in rodents is used to assess change in inflammatory cell infiltrates and vascular plaque growth (rejection). Utilization of the combination of these in vitro and in vivo techniques allows for a more complete study of the chemokine-modulating activity of M-T7, and can be used to study other immune and inflammation-modulating proteins.</ab>

<ab>BACKGROUND: In previous studies we have demonstrated that Serp-1, a myxoma virus encoded serine protease inhibitor, dramatically inhibits neointimal hyperplasia in vascular injury and aortic transplant models. Here we examined the effect of peritransplant Serp-1 administration on chronic renal allograft rejection. METHODS: Rat renal transplants were performed with sequential recipient sacrifice on postoperative days 2, 10 and 140 to examine both the acute and chronic effects of Serp-1 in recipient rats. RESULTS: Serp-1 administration reduced early posttransplant injury (POD 2) with less acute tubular and vascular necrosis. This translated into a reduction of the characteristic late stage changes of chronic rejection (POD 140), with significantly decreased glomerulosclerosis and neointimal hyperplasia. Effects of Serp-1 treatment were already evident as early as POD 2 with markedly decreased levels of TGF-beta mRNA witnessed at both the early and late time points (POD 2, 10 and 140). CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that peritransplant Serp-1 viral protein decreased early injury and allowed reduced chronic rejection in a rat renal model. Recipients treated with Serp-1 are associated with a decrease in TGF-beta mRNA levels in the allografts suggesting that the serine protease inhibitor may inhibit TGF-beta transcription and its profibrotic effects.</ab>

<ab>M-T7 is a myxoma virus-encoded protein that has been found to bind and disrupt human chemokine gradients. This study examined whether purified M-T7 could prevent chronic rejection in a rat renal allograft model. Fisher F344 renal allografts were transplanted into Lewis rats. Recipients were randomly grouped into two groups: control animals treated with cyclosporine alone and animals treated with cyclosporine combined with low-, medium- and high-dose M-T7 viral protein. The survival rate was not significantly different between allograft groups. Renal allografts treated with high-dose M-T7 demonstrated a significant reduction in tubular atrophy, glomerular atrophy, vascular hyalinization, cortical scarring, and lymphocyte infiltration. Morphometric analyses demonstrated that the high-dose M-T7 group also showed a significantly decreased amount of glomerulosclerosis and transplant arteriosclerosis. These data demonstrate for the first time that the immunoregulatory viral protein M-T7 can effectively attenuate chronic rejection in rat renal allografts.</ab>

<ab>The genome of malignant rabbit virus (MRV), a newly discovered tumorigenic poxvirus of rabbits, has been analyzed using cloned DNA probes from Shope fibroma virus (SFV) and myxoma virus. Under high stringency conditions for Southern blotting such that SFV probes do not cross-hybridize with myxoma virus DNA, it is demonstrated that greater than 90% of the MRV genome has been derived from myxoma virus, and that approximately 10 kb of SFV-derived sequences have substituted for a similar amount of myxoma sequences. Mapping of the MRV genome indicates that the SFV sequences are present in two regions of the genome, one in each copy of the MRV terminal inverted repeat sequence. Furthermore, fine mapping studies of the integration sites for SFV into the myxoma background show that these SFV sequences are not symmetrical with respect to the left and right genomic termini. At the left end, 4 kb of SFV-derived DNA maps between 6 and 10 kb from the terminus, while at the right end about 5.5 kb of SFV sequences are found to extend at least 1 kb further toward the unique internal sequences. Based on this asymmetrical bipartite distribution of SFV sequences in MRV, a two-stage model to rationalize the origin of MRV is proposed. This model postulates an initial recombination event similar to gene conversion between myxoma and SFV at the right terminus of myxoma, followed by an incomplete transposition of only part of these SFV sequences to the left terminus.</ab>

<ab>Shope fibroma virus (SFV) is a leporipoxvirus that causes localized benign fibromas in immunocompetent adult rabbits that spontaneously regress due, in part, to a cell-mediated immune response. Myxoma virus (MYX) and malignant rabbit fibroma virus (MRV) are related leporipoxviruses that induce rapidly lethal generalized infections accompanied by tumors and immunosuppression. Because only these latter two viruses are known to compromise cell-mediated antiviral responses, cell surface levels of class I MHC molecules in SFV-, MRV-, and MYX-infected cells were investigated by fluorescent activated cell sorting analysis using a variety of different anti-HLA mAb. After infection with MYX or MRV there is a rapid decrease in the levels of detectable surface class I epitopes as detected by each antibody and by 24 h postinfection class I MHC Ag levels at the cell surface approach the level of background fluorescence observed with control antibodies. In contrast, only a moderate class I decrease is seen during infection with either SFV or vaccinia virus, an orthopoxvirus that is neither tumorigenic nor immunosuppressive. Surface class I marker loss induced by MYX and MRV is not simply due to nonspecific inhibition of total cellular protein synthesis by the viruses because class I levels decrease much further than the extent measured by estimating surface marker turnover in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Thus the loss of cellular surface class I molecules greatly exceeds the drop in level caused by complete blockage of host cell gene expression, and must involve removal or masking of preexisting class I epitopes from the cell surface by MRV/MYX. Cell surface levels of the transferrin receptor are unaffected by MYX and MRV infection, suggesting the observed class I decrease is not a nonspecific effect on total cell surface glycoproteins. Analysis of cells infected with MRV/MYX in the presence of cycloheximide or of cytosine arabinoside, an inhibitor of poxviral DNA replication, indicates that the class I marker loss is mediated in part by one or more viral late gene products. A probable explanation is that MRV/MYX late protein(s) interact with the class I MHC complex to either physically sequester these away from the cell surface and inhibit their recycling or else induce a conformational change that precludes recognition by all class I antibodies tested. In either event, we propose that such a major perturbation of the class I MHC complex would likely downregulate the class I-mediated presentation of viral Ag required to initiate cell-mediated immunity to these viruses.</ab>

<ab>The Yatapoxvirus genus of poxviruses is comprised of Yaba monkey tumor virus (YMTV), Tanapox virus, and Yaba-like disease virus (YLDV), which all have the ability to infect primates, including humans. Unlike other poxviruses, YMTV induces formation of focalized histiocytomas upon infection. To gain a greater understanding of the Yatapoxvirus genus and the unique tumor formation properties of YMTV, we sequenced the 134,721-bp genome of YMTV. The genome of YMTV encodes at least 140 open reading frames, all of which are also found as orthologs in the closely related YLDV. However, 13 open reading frames found in YLDV are completely absent from YMTV. Common to both YLDV and YMTV are the unusually large noncoding regions between many open reading frames. To determine whether any of these noncoding regions might be functionally significant, we carried out a comparative analysis between the putative noncoding regions of YMTV and similar noncoding regions from other poxviruses. This approach identified three new gene poxvirus families, defined as orthologs of YMTV23.5L, YMTV28.5L, and YMTV120.5L, which are highly conserved in virtually all poxvirus species. Furthermore, the comparative analysis also revealed a 40-bp nucleotide sequence at approximately 14,700 bases from the left terminus that was 100% identical in the comparable intergene site within members of the Yatapoxvirus, Suipoxvirus, and Capripoxvirus genera and 95% conserved in the Leporipoxvirus genus. This conserved sequence was shown to function as a poxvirus late promoter element in transfected and infected cells, but other functions, such as an involvement in viral replication or packaging, cannot be excluded. Finally, we summarize the predicted immunomodulatory protein repertoire in the Yatapoxvirus genus as a whole.</ab>

<ab>A class of secreted poxvirus tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-binding proteins has been isolated from Tanapox-infected cell supernatants. The inhibitor bound to a TNF-affinity column and was identified as the product of the 2L gene. Sequence analysis of 2L family members from other yatapoxviruses and swinepox virus yielded no sequence homology to any known cellular gene. The expressed Tanapox virus 2L protein bound to human TNF with high affinity (K(d) = 43 pM) and exhibits an unusually slow off-rate. However, 2L is unable to bind to a wide range of human TNF family members. The 2L protein can inhibit human TNF from binding to TNF receptors I and II as well as block TNF-induced cytolysis. Thus, Tanapox virus 2L represents an inhibitor of human TNF and offers a unique strategy with which to modulate TNF activity.</ab>

<ab>Myxomatosis in European rabbits is a severely debilitating disease characterized by profound systemic cellular immunosuppression and a high rate of mortality. The causative agent, myxoma virus, is a member of the poxvirus family and prototype of the Leporipoxvirus genus. As a major step toward defining the genetic strategies by which the virus circumvents host antiviral responses, the genomic DNA sequence of myxoma virus, strain Lausanne, was determined. A total of 171 open reading frames were assigned to cover the 161.8-kb genome, including two copies each of the 12 genes that map within the 11.5-kb terminal inverted repeats. Database searches revealed a central core of approximately 120 kb that encodes more than 100 genes that exhibit close relationships to the conserved genes of members of other poxvirus genera. Open reading frames with predicted signal sequences, localization motifs, or homology to known proteins with immunomodulatory or host-range functions were examined more extensively for predicted features such as hydrophobic regions, nucleic acid binding domains, ankyrin repeats, serpin signatures, lectin domains. and structural cysteine spacings. As a result, several novel, potentially immunomodulatory proteins have been identified, including a family with multiple ankyrin-repeat domains, an OX-2 like member of the neural cell adhesion molecule family, a third myxoma serpin, a putative chemokine receptor fragment, two natural killer receptor-like species, and a variety of species with domains closely related to diverse host immune regulatory proteins. Coupled with the genomic sequencing of the related leporipoxvirus Shope fibroma virus, this work affirms the existence of a conserved complement of poxvirus-specific core genes and expands the growing repertoire of virus genes that confer the unique capacity of each poxvirus family member to counter the immune responses of the infected host.</ab>

<ab>M141R is a myxoma virus gene that encodes a cell surface protein with significant amino acid similarity to the family of cellular CD200 (OX-2) proteins implicated in the regulation of myeloid lineage cell activation. The creation of an M141R deletion mutant myxoma virus strain (vMyx141KO) and its subsequent infection of European rabbits demonstrated that M141R is required for the full development of a lethal infection in vivo but is not required for efficient virus replication in susceptible cell lines in vitro. Minor secondary sites of infection were detected in the majority of rabbits infected with the M141R deletion mutant, demonstrating that the M141R protein is not required for the dissemination of virus within the host. When compared to wild-type myxoma virus-infected rabbits, vMyx141KO-infected rabbits showed higher activation levels of both monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes in situ through assessments of inducible nitric oxide synthase-positive and CD25(+) infiltrating cells in infected and lymphoid tissues. Purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells from vMyx141KO-infected rabbits demonstrated an increased ability to express gamma interferon upon activation by phorbol myristate acetate plus ionomycin compared to cells purified from wild-type myxoma virus-infected rabbits. We concluded that the M141R protein is a bona fide CD200-like immunomodulator protein which is required for the full pathogenesis of myxoma virus in the European rabbit and that its loss from the virus results in increased activation levels of macrophages in infected lesions and draining lymph nodes as well as an increased activation level of circulating T lymphocytes during infection. We propose a model whereby M141R transmits inhibitory signals to tissue macrophages, and possibly resident CD200R(+) dendritic cells, that reduce their ability to antigenically prime lymphocytes and possibly provides anergic signals to T cells directly.</ab>

<ab>The M128L myxoma virus gene expresses a five-membrane spanning cell surface protein with significant amino acid homology to the cellular CD47 proteins. CD47, also called integrin-associated protein (IAP), is associated with the modulation of leukocyte adhesion, motility, activation, and phagocytosis. Creation of an M128L-deletion mutant myxoma virus strain and subsequent infection of the European rabbit demonstrated that M128L is necessary for the production of a lethal infection in susceptible rabbits, while it is fully dispensable for virus replication in vitro. Secondary sites of infection developed on the majority of rabbits infected with the M128L-deletion mutant (vMyx128KO), demonstrating that the M128L protein is nonessential for the dissemination of virus within the host. Although the size and severity of the primary lesions on vMyx128KO-infected rabbits were comparable to rabbits infected with the wild-type virus at the early stages of disease progression, by day 7 the reduced virulence of the vMyx128KO virus was clearly evident and all of the animals recovered from infection by the M128L-knockout virus. Histological analysis of the tissues of vMyx128KO-infected rabbits revealed greater activation of monocyte/macrophage cells in infected and/or lymphoid tissues when compared to those of wild-type myxoma-infected rabbits. We conclude that the M128L protein is a novel CD47-like immunomodulatory gene of myxoma virus required for full pathogenesis of the virus in the European rabbit and that its loss from the virus results in increased activation of monocyte/macrophage cells during infection.</ab>

<ab>Myxoma M118L ORF has the capacity to encode a 76 amino acid protein that is highly conserved in other vertebrate poxviruses including vaccinia (A30L), molluscum contagiosum (MC136L), yaba tumour virus (D13L) and fowlpox virus (FPV 194). The time course analysis by Western blotting using M118L antibody showed that the M118L ORF is expressed as a typical poxvirus late gene. The M118L protein can be detected in both the virus infected cytosolic and membrane fractions, even though the M118L protein does not possess a predicted transmembrane domain. The protein was found to be associated with the sucrose gradient purified myxoma intracellular mature virus (IMV) as determined by Western blotting with M118L antibody. Furthermore, the M118L protein associated with the IMV can be surface labeled with water-soluble biotin and is released from the purified IMV with treatment of nonionic detergent NP-40, indicating that the M118L protein is associated with the outer membrane of myxoma IMV. Unexpectedly, an IMV-associated M118L protein isoform was observed to bind tightly to Streptavidin beads, unlike the six other detectable myxoma IMV surface proteins, suggesting an unusual post-translational modification, such as biotinylation. Extensive attempts to generate the M118L deletion mutant using standard homologous recombination technique with E. coli gpt gene as a positive selection marker were unsuccessful. Although PCR analysis clearly indicated the presence of the correctly targeted M118L deletion mutants in mixed recombinant virus plaques selected with mycophenolic acid (MPA), repeated passages and plaquing failed to segregate the pure M118L deletion mutant from either single crossover recombinants or regenerated wild type parental viruses. Taken together, our data strongly indicate that the M118L is a novel poxvirus IMV associated protein that is essential for virus viability.</ab>

<ab>Vertebrate poxviruses encode homologs of cellular cupro-zinc superoxide dismutases (Cu-Zn SOD). In this study we have examined the molecular genetic properties of two Cu-Zn SOD homologs encoded by the Shope fibroma virus (SFV) and myxoma virus. These Leporipoxvirus proteins should be catalytically inactive as judged by the point mutations which alter a key catalytic arginine and restructure the predicted Cu-binding domain. This prediction was confirmed using in situ gel assays and recombinant proteins produced both in bacteria and in mammalian cells. Western blot analysis showed that these proteins are produced in abundance late in infection and can, upon exposure to oxidizing conditions, form disulfide cross-linked dimers. They are also virion components and not essential for growth in culture or virulence. Leporipoxvirus Cu-Zn SOD homologs affected two phenotypes. First, deletion of the myxoma M131R gene caused the mutant virus to grow better ( approximately 10-fold) in culture than does the wild-type parent. Second, expression of either native or recombinant Leporipoxvirus proteins is accompanied by a decline in cellular Cu-Zn SOD activity. We concluded that these gene products can somehow modulate the activity of host Cu-Zn SODs, but what advantage is thus gained by the virus remains to be established.</ab>

<ab>A hybridoma, CSC-1, which secretes monoclonal antibody (MAb) specific for a cell surface molecule on African green monkey kidney cell line, BGMK, was isolated and characterized. The cell surface molecule recognized by CSC-1 is widely expressed on a variety of human cell lines. Among the hematopoietic cell lines examined, the CSC-1 marker seems to be preferentially expressed by lymphoid cell lines (e.g., Raji, CEM-SS, Jurkat, and MOLT-3). Although CSC-1 also recognizes some uncommitted myeloid and erythroleukemia cell lines (e.g., U-937 and K562), the CSC-1 marker expression on these cell lines is subjected to PMA-induced down-regulation. In addition, the PMA-induced cell surface down-regulation of the CSC-1 marker required more than 24 h. Proteolytic analysis shows that the CSC-1 marker can be categorized into proteinase K-resistant and-sensitive phenotypes. Furthermore, the CSC-1 marker exhibits a slow cell surface turnover rate after proteinase K treatment. Our data suggest that the CSC-1 cell surface molecule might be useful as a megakaryocytic or monocytic differentiation marker.</ab>

<ab>A mouse IgG(1)-producing hybridoma, CSC-31, was isolated and characterized. The monoclonal antibody (MAb) was originally raised against monkey kidney cell-surface molecules. FACS analysis further showed that CSC-31 exhibited broad tissue and species reactivity. Although most human T- and B-cell lines failed to react with CSC-31, myeloid, and erythroleukemia cells lines such as THP-1 and K562 expressed the CSC-31 cell surface marker. Furthermore, in vitro differentiation of HL-60, U-937, and K562 showed that expression of the CSC-31 marker is associated with monocytic or megakaryocytic differentiation. However, up-regulation of the CSC-31 marker expression was not detected during granulocytic or erythroid differentiation. Through the in vitro differentiation of K562, it was demonstrated that up-regulation of the CSC-31 marker required novel PKCs and might be regulated by the MAPK signaling pathway. Last, limited biochemical analysis demonstrated that the CSC-31-specific epitope is sensitive to digestion by papain yet highly resistant to other proteases.</ab>

<ab>The transcription and translation of an epidermal growth factor (EGF) related gene in the Leporipoxvirus Shope fibroma virus (SFV), termed the Shope fibroma growth factor (SFGF), have been characterized. Three early RNA transcripts complimentary to an anti-SFGF oligonucleotide were detected by Northern blot analysis, while no late transcripts were expressed. The activity of the SFGF early promoter was measured using a transient gene expression assay in SFV-infected cells using the bacterial choloramphenicol acetyltransferase as a reporter gene. Deletion analysis showed that the functional SFGF promoter domain is an AT-rich sequence contained within 30 bp of the major transcriptional initiation site as is typical of early poxvirus promoters. An intracellular form of the SFGF gene product was immunoprecipitated from infected lysates using rabbit antisera raised against a synthetic SFGF (amino acids 26-80). A 16-kDa product was detected, while in cells infected in the presence of tunicamycin, the immunoprecipitated product had a mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels of approximately 6 kDa, indicating that the SFGF gene product is extensively post-transcriptionally modified. The intracellular 16-kDa form can be pulse-chased to a 14-kDa form but the secreted form of SFGF could not be detected in the medium using this anti-peptide antiserum.</ab>

<ab>Fluorescence emission analysis (FEA) has proven to be very sensitive for the detection of elastin, collagen and lipids, which are recognized as the major sources of autofluorescence in vascular tissues. FEA has also been reported to detect venous thromboemboli. In this paper we have tested the hypothesis that FEA can reproducibly detect in vivo and in vitro triggered plaque disruption and thrombosis in a rabbit model. Fluorescence emission (FE) spectra, recorded in vivo, detected Russell&amp;#39;s viper venom (RVV)-induced transformation of atherosclerotic plaque. FE intensity at 410-490 nm 4 weeks after angioplasty was significantly lower (P &amp;lt; 0.0033 by analysis of variance) in RVV-treated rabbits when compared to control animals with stable plaque. FE spectral profile analyses also demonstrated a significant change in curve shape as demonstrated by polynomial regression analysis (R2 from 0.980 to 0.997). We have also demonstrated an excellent correlation between changes in FE intensity and the structural characteristics detected at different stages of &amp;quot;unstable atherosclerotic plaque&amp;quot; development using multiple regression analysis (R2 = 0.989). Thus, FEA applied in vivo is a sensitive and highly informative diagnostic technique for detection of triggered atherosclerotic plaque disruption and related structural changes, associated with plaque transformation, in a rabbit model.</ab>

<ab>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Transplant vasculopathy is a leading cause of late cardiac graft loss. We have examined laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) spectroscopy as an optical diagnostic tool for detection of intimal plaque development and inflammatory cellular invasion in a rat model of aortic allograft transplant. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Infrarenal aortic segments were transplanted from Lewis to Sprague Dawley rats. A range of vasculopathy development was produced by treatment with a viral anti-inflammatory protein. LIF spectra were recorded from the intima of aortic implants at 28 days. Fluorescence intensity was analyzed for correlation with vasculopathy development. RESULTS: Significant differences in LIF intensity at 400-450 nm (P &amp;lt; or = 0.05 by ANOVA) were detected. LIF emission was correlated with plaque growth (R2 = 0.980), vessel narrowing (R2 = 0.964), and cellular invasion (R2 = 0.971) by regression analysis. CONCLUSION: LIF optical analysis provides a nontraumatic diagnostic approach for detection of atherosclerosis prior to cardiac transplant or during development of vasculopathy after transplant.</ab>

<ab>Complex DNA viruses have tapped into cellular serpin responses that act as key regulatory steps in coagulation and inflammatory cascades. Serp-1 is one such viral serpin that effectively protects virus-infected tissues from host inflammatory responses. When given as purified protein, Serp-1 markedly inhibits vascular monocyte invasion and plaque growth in animal models. We have investigated mechanisms of viral serpin inhibition of vascular inflammatory responses. In vascular injury models, Serp-1 altered early cellular plasminogen activator (tissue plasminogen activator), inhibitor (PAI-1), and receptor (urokinase-type plasminogen activator) expression (p &amp;lt; 0.01). Serp-1, but not a reactive center loop mutant, up-regulated PAI-1 serpin expression in human endothelial cells. Treatment of endothelial cells with antibody to urokinase-type plasminogen activator and vitronectin blocked Serp-1-induced changes. Significantly, Serp-1 blocked intimal hyperplasia (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) after aortic allograft transplant (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) in PAI-1-deficient mice. Serp-1 also blocked plaque growth after aortic isograft transplant and after wire-induced injury (p &amp;lt; 0.05) in PAI-1-deficient mice indicating that increase in PAI-1 expression is not required for Serp-1 to block vasculopathy development. Serp-1 did not inhibit plaque growth in uPAR-deficient mice after aortic allograft transplant. We conclude that the poxviral serpin, Serp-1, attenuates vascular inflammatory responses to injury through a pathway mediated by native uPA receptors and vitronectin.</ab>

<ab>BACKGROUND: Binding of chemokines to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) is classically described as initiating inflammatory cell migration and creating tissue chemokine gradients that direct local leukocyte chemotaxis into damaged or transplanted tissues. While chemokine-receptor binding has been extensively studied during allograft transplantation, effects of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) interactions with chemokines on transplant longevity are less well known. Here we examine the impact of interrupting chemokine-GAG interactions and chemokine-receptor interactions, both locally and systemically, on vascular disease in allografts. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Analysis of GAG or CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) deficiency were coupled with the infusion of viral chemokine modulating proteins (CMPs) in mouse aortic allograft transplants (n = 239 mice). Inflammatory cell invasion and neointimal hyperplasia were significantly reduced in N-deacetylase-N-sulfotransferase-1 (Ndst1(f/f)TekCre(+)) heparan sulfate (GAG)-deficient (Ndst1(-/-), p&amp;lt;0.044) and CCR2-deficient (Ccr2(-/-), p&amp;lt;0.04) donor transplants. Donor tissue GAG or CCR2 deficiency markedly reduced inflammation and vasculopathy, whereas recipient deficiencies did not. Treatment with three CMPs was also investigated; Poxviral M-T1 blocks CC chemokine receptor binding, M-T7 blocks C, CC, and CXC GAG binding, and herpesviral M3 binds receptor and GAG binding for all classes. M-T7 reduced intimal hyperplasia in wild type (WT) (Ccr2(+/+), p&amp;lt; or =0.003 and Ccr2(-/-), p&amp;lt;/=0.027) aortic allografts, but not in Ndst1(-/-) aortic allografts (p = 0.933). M-T1 and M3 inhibited WT (Ccr2(+/+) and Ndst1(+/+), p&amp;lt; or =0.006) allograft vasculopathy, but did not block vasculopathy in Ccr2(-/-) (p = 0.61). M-T7 treatment alone, even without immunosuppressive drugs, also significantly prolonged survival of renal allograft transplants (p&amp;lt; or =0.001). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Interruption of chemokine-GAG interactions, even in the absence of chemokine-receptor blockade, is a highly effective approach to reduction of allograft rejection, reducing vascular inflammation and prolonging allograft survival. Although chemokines direct both local and systemic cell migration, interruption of inherent chemokine responses in the donor tissue unexpectedly had a greater therapeutic impact on allograft vasculopathy.</ab>

<ab>The thrombolytic serine protease cascade is intricately involved in activation of innate immune responses. The urokinase-type plasminogen activator and receptor form complexes that aid inflammatory cell invasion at sites of arterial injury. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 is a mammalian serpin that binds and regulates the urokinase receptor complex. Serp-1, a myxomaviral serpin, also targets the urokinase receptor, displaying profound anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic activity in a wide range of animal models. Serp-1 reactive center site mutations, mimicking known mammalian and viral serpins, were constructed in order to define sequences responsible for regulation of inflammation. Thrombosis, inflammation, and plaque growth were assessed after treatment with Serp-1, Serp-1 chimeras, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, or unrelated viral serpins in plasminogen activator inhibitor or urokinase receptor-deficient mouse aortic transplants. Altering the P1-P1&amp;#39; Arg-Asn sequence compromised Serp-1 protease-inhibitory activity and anti-inflammatory activity in animal models; P1-P1&amp;#39; Ala-Ala mutants were inactive, P1 Met increased remodeling, and P1&amp;#39; Thr increased thrombosis. Substitution of Serp-1 P2-P7 with Ala6 allowed for inhibition of urokinase but lost plasmin inhibition, unexpectedly inducing a diametrically opposed, proinflammatory response with mononuclear cell activation, thrombosis, and aneurysm formation (p &amp;lt; 0.03). Other serpins did not reproduce Serp-1 activity; plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 increased thrombosis (p &amp;lt; 0.0001), and unrelated viral serpin, CrmA, increased inflammation. Deficiency of urokinase receptor in mouse transplants blocked Serp-1 and chimera activity, in some cases increasing inflammation. In summary, 1) Serp-1 anti-inflammatory activity is highly dependent upon the reactive center loop sequence, and 2) plasmin inhibition is central to anti-inflammatory activity.</ab>

<ab>The vaccinia virus DNA telomere, which contains a covalently closed hairpin structure, has been cloned in a yeast plasmid vector. Restriction mapping indicates that the cloned vaccinia telomere is maintained in yeast not in its native hairpin configuration but as an inverted repeat structure, within a circular plasmid, with the sequences of the viral hairpin now at the axis of symmetry of an imperfect palindrome. As such, the cloned telomere resembles the telomeric replicative intermediate observed during vaccinia virus DNA replication. Small deletions and duplications in the viral inverted repeats of different clones suggest a model in which the observed circular plasmids were generated in yeast by the replication of hybrid linear DNA molecules consisting of the linearized yeast vector flanked by two hairpin-containing vaccinia termini.</ab>

<ab>The sites for the restriction enzymes BamHI, Bg/I, HindIII, PstI, PvuII, and SstI on the linear DNA genome of Shope fibroma virus, a tumorigenic poxvirus of rabbits, have been determined by digestions of the cloned BamHI and HindIII restriction fragments and by hybridization of 32P-labeled cloned fragments to Southern blots of Shope fibroma virus DNA cleaved partially or completely with the various enzymes. The linear genome is shown to be 160 kilobases in length and to possess terminal inverted repeat sequences of between 12.2 and 12.5 kilobases extending inwards from the cross-linked DNA telomeres. The fine map of the Shope fibroma virus terminal inverted repeats has been constructed and shown to be distinctly different from that of members of the orthopoxvirus group, such as vaccinia, by the absence of detectable tandemly repeated sequences near the termini and by the lack of detectable sequence homology with vaccinia termini.</ab>

<ab>The terminal hairpin sequences of the linear double-stranded DNA genome of the leporipoxvirus Shope fibroma virus (SFV) has been cloned in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in recombination-deficient Escherichia coli as a palindromic insert within circular plasmid vectors. This sequence configuration is equivalent to the inverted repeat structure detected as a telomeric replicative intermediate during poxvirus replication in vivo. Previously, it has been shown that when circular plasmids containing this palindromic insert were transfected into SFV-infected cells, efficient replication and resolution generated linear minichromosomes with bona fide viral hairpin termini (A. M. DeLange, M. Reddy, D. Scraba, C. Upton, and G. McFadden, J. Virol. 59:249-259, 1986). To localize the minimal target DNA sequence required for efficient resolution, a series of staggered unidirectional deletions were constructed at both ends of the inverted repeat. Analyses of the resolution efficiencies of the various clones indicate that up to 240 base pairs (bp) centered at the symmetry axis were required for maximal resolution to minichromosomes. To investigate the role of the AT-rich central axis sequences, which in SFV include 8 nonpalindromic bp, a unique AflII site at the symmetry axis was exploited. Bidirectional deletions extending from this AflII site and insertions of synthetic oligonucleotides into one of the deletion derivatives were constructed and tested in vivo. The efficiency with which these plasmids resolved to linear minichromosomes with hairpin termini has enabled us to define the minimal target DNA sequence as two inverted copies of an identical DNA sequence between 58 and 76 bp in length. The nonpalindromic nucleotides, which, after resolution, constitute the extrahelical residues characteristic of native poxviral telomeres, were not required for resolution. The close resemblance of the SFV core target sequence to the analogous region from the orthopoxvirus vaccinia virus is consistent with a conserved mechanism for poxviral telomere resolution.</ab>

<ab>A system in which transfected plasmid DNA replicates in the cytoplasm of poxvirus-infected cells is described. A variety of recombinant plasmids was introduced into poxvirus-infected cells by transfection, and replication of input plasmid DNA was monitored by (i) digestion with restriction enzymes that discriminate between input methylated plasmid DNA and unmethylated DNA produced by replication in mammalian cells; (ii) amplification of intracellular plasmid DNA; and (iii) density shift analysis in the presence of BrdUrd. Replication of plasmid DNA was observed in the cytoplasm of cells infected with the tumorigenic leporipoxviruses Shope fibroma virus (SFV) and myxoma, and less extensively with the orthopoxvirus vaccinia, but not in uninfected cells. Unexpectedly, all input plasmids tested, including pBR322, pUC13, polyoma, PM2 phi X174 replicative form (RF), and M13 RF, replicated with equal efficiency in SFV-infected cells, indicating that no specific replication origin sequence is required. The transfected plasmid DNA was replicated concomitantly with the infecting poxviral DNA and by 24 hr post-transfection, it resided predominantly in high molecular weight Dpn I-resistant head-to-tail tandem repeats. The failure to detect unreplicated Dpn I-sensitive plasmid concatemers early in replication together with the absence of significant levels of integrated plasmid sequences in the poxviral genome suggest that replication of the transfected plasmid DNA is not the consequence of nonhomologous recombination of concatemeric plasmid DNA into the poxvirus genome, but rather of an autonomous process that is dependent on trans-acting replication factors produced during virus infection, and that does not require a specific origin sequence on the substrate plasmid DNA.</ab>

<ab>The covalently closed terminal hairpins of the linear duplex-DNA genomes of the orthopoxvirus vaccinia and the leporipoxvirus Shope fibroma virus (SFV) have been cloned as imperfect palindromes within circular plasmids in yeast cells and recombination-deficient Escherichia coli. The viral telomeres inserted within these recombinant plasmids are equivalent to the inverted-repeat structures detected as telomeric replicative intermediates during poxvirus replication in vivo. Although the telomeres of vaccinia and SFV show little sequence homology, the termini from both viral genomes exist as AT-rich terminal hairpins with extrahelical bases and alternate &amp;quot;flip-flop&amp;quot; configurations. Using an in vivo replication assay in which circular plasmid DNA was transfected into poxvirus-infected cells, we demonstrated the efficient replication and resolution of the cloned imperfect palindromes to bona fide hairpin termini. The resulting linear minichromosomes, which were readily purified from transfected cells, were shown by restriction enzyme mapping and by electron microscopy to have intact covalently closed hairpin termini at both ends. In addition, staggered unidirectional deletion derivatives of both the cloned vaccinia and SFV telomeric palindromes localized an approximately 200-base-pair DNA region in which the sequence organization was highly conserved and which was necessary for the resolution event. These data suggest a conserved mechanism of the resolution of poxvirus telomeres.</ab>

<ab>Various branched DNA structures were created from synthetic, partly complementary oligonucleotides combined under annealing conditions. Appropriate mixtures of oligonucleotides generated three specific branched duplex DNA molecules: (i) a Holliday junction analog having a fixed (immobile) crossover bounded by four duplex DNA branches, (ii) a similar Holliday junction analog which is capable of limited branch migration and, (iii) a Y-junction, with three duplex branches and fixed branch point. Each of these novel structures was specifically cleaved by bacteriophage T7 gene 3 product, endonuclease I. The cleavage reaction &amp;quot;resolved&amp;quot; the two Holliday structure analogs into pairs of duplex DNA products half the size of the original molecules. The point of cleavage in the fixed-junction molecules was predominantly one nucleotide removed to the 5&amp;#39; side of the expected crossover position. Multiple cleavage positions were mapped on the Holliday junction with the mobile, or variable, branch point, to sites consistent with the unrestricted movement of the phosphodiester crossover within the region of limited dyad symmetry which characterizes this molecule. Based on the cleavage pattern observed with this latter substrate, the enzyme displayed a modest degree of sequence specificity, preferring a pyrimidine on the 3&amp;#39; side of the cleavage site. Branched molecules that were partial duplexes (lower order complexes which possessed single-stranded as well as duplex DNA branches) were also substrates for the enzyme. In these molecules, the cleaved phosphodiester bonds were in duplex regions only and predominantly one nucleotide to the 5&amp;#39; side of the branch point. The phosphodiester positions 5&amp;#39; of the branch point in single-stranded arms were not cleaved. Under identical reaction conditions, individually treated oligonucleotides were completely refractory. Thus, cleavage by T7 endonuclease I displays great structural specificity with an efficiency that can vary slightly according to the DNA sequence.</ab>

<ab>The variable positions of a branch-migrating cruciform junction in supercoiled plasmid DNA were mapped following cleavage of the DNA with bacteriophage T7 endonuclease I. T7 endonuclease I specifically cleaved, and thereby resolved, the Holliday junction existing at the base of the cruciform in the circular bacterial plasmid pSA1B.56A. Cruciform extrusion of cloned sequences in pSA1B.56A (containing a 322 base-pair inverted repeat insert composed of poxvirus telomeric sequences) topologically relaxed the plasmid substrate in vitro. Thus, numerous crossover positions were identified within the region of cloned sequences, reflecting the range of superhelical densities in the native plasmid preparation. Endonuclease I-sensitive crossover positions, mapped to both strands of the viral insert following the T7 endonuclease I digestion of either plasmid preparations or individual topoisomers, were regularly separated by approximately ten nucleotides. The appearance of sensitive crossovers every ten nucleotides corresponds to a change in linking difference (delta Lk) of +/- 2 in the circular core domain of the plasmid during branch point migration. In contrast, individual topoisomers of a plasmid preparation differ in linking number in increments of +/- 1. Thus, the observed linearization of each individual topoisomer following enzyme treatment, as a result of resolution of the crossovers associated with each topoisomer, showed that branch point migration to sensitive crossover positions must have occurred facilely. T7 endonuclease I randomly resolved across either axis of the cruciform, though some discrimination (related to the sequence specificity of the enzyme) was observed. The ten-nucleotide spacing between sensitive crossover positions is accounted for by an isomerization of the cruciform junction on branch point migration. An hypothesis is that this isomerization was imposed upon the cruciform junction by the change in helix twist (delta Tw) in the two branches that compose the topologically closed, circular domain of the plasmid. T7 endonuclease I may discriminate between the various isomeric forms and cleave a sensitive conformation that appears with every turn of branch migration which leads to the extrusion, or absorption, of two turns of helix from the circular core.</ab>

<ab>The transition from lineform DNA to cruciform DNA (cruciformation) within the cloned telomere sequences of the Leporipoxvirus Shope fibroma virus (SFV) has been studied. The viral telomere sequences have been cloned in recombination-deficient Escherichia coli as a 322 base-pair, imperfect palindromic insert in pUC13. The inverted repeat configuration is equivalent to the arrangement of the telomere structures observed within viral DNA replicative intermediates. A major cruciform structure in the purified recombinant plasmid has been identified and mapped using, as probes, the enzymes AflII, nuclease S1 and bacteriophage T7 endonuclease I. It was extruded from the central axis of the cloned viral inverted repeat and, by unrestricted branch migration, attained a size commensurate with the superhelical density of the plasmid molecule at native superhelical densities. This major cruciform extrusion event was the only detectable duplex DNA perturbation, induced by negative superhelical torsion, in the insert viral sequences. No significant steady-state pool of extruded cruciform was identified in E. coli. However, the identification of a major deletion variant generated even in the recombination-deficient E. coli strain DB1256 (recA recBC sbcB) suggested that the cruciform may be extruded transiently in vivo. The lineform to cruciform transition has been further characterized in vitro using two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis. The transition was marked by a high energy of formation (delta Gf = 44 kcal/mol), and an apparently low activation energy that enabled facile transitions at physiological temperatures provided there was sufficient torsional energy. By comparing cruciformation in a series of related bidirectional central axis deletions of the telomeric insert, it has been concluded that the presence of extrahelical bases in the terminal hairpin structures contributes substantially to the high delta Gf value. Also, viral sequences flanking the extruded cruciform were shown to influence the measured delta Gf value. Several general features of poxvirus telomere structure that would be expected to influence the facility of cruciform extrusion are discussed along with the implications of the observed cruciform transition event on the replicative process of poxviruses in vivo.</ab>

<ab>Apoptosis of virally infected cells is an innate host mechanism used to prevent viral spread. However, viruses have evolved a number of proteins that function to modulate the apoptotic cascades and thereby favor productive viral replication. One such antiapoptotic protein, myxoma virus M11L, has been shown to inhibit mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis by binding to and blocking the two executioner proteins Bak and Bax. Since M11L has no obvious sequence homology with Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L), the normal cellular inhibitors for Bak and Bax, and the structure of M11L has not been solved, the mode of binding to Bak and Bax is not known. In order to understand how M11L functions, the crystal structure of M11L was solved to 2.91 A. Despite the lack of sequence similarity, M11L is a structural homolog of Bcl-2. Studies using a peptide derived from Bak indicate that M11L binds to Bak with a similar affinity (4.9 +/- 0.3 microM) to the published binding affinities of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) to the same peptide (12.7 microM and 0.5 microM, respectively), indicating that M11L inhibits apoptosis by mimicking and competing with host proteins for the binding of Bak and Bax. The structure provides important insight into how myxoma virus and other poxviruses facilitate viral dissemination by inhibiting mitochondrial dependent apoptosis.</ab>

<ab>Alcoholic cardiomyopathy is characterized by impaired ventricular function although its toxic mechanism is unclear. This study examined the impact of cardiac overexpression of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), which oxidizes ethanol into acetaldehyde (ACA), on ethanol-induced cardiac contractile defect. Mechanical and intracellular Ca(2+) properties were evaluated in ventricular myocytes from ADH transgenic and wild-type (FVB) mice. ACA production was assessed by gas chromatography. ADH myocytes exhibited similar mechanical properties but a higher efficiency to convert ACA compared with FVB myocytes. Acute exposure to ethanol depressed cell shortening and intracellular Ca(2+) in the FVB group with maximal inhibitions of 23.3% and 23.4%, respectively. Strikingly, the ethanol-induced depression on cell shortening and intracellular Ca(2+) was significantly augmented in the ADH group, with maximal inhibitions of 43.7% and 40.6%, respectively. Pretreatment with the ADH inhibitor 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP) or the aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor cyanamide prevented or augmented the ethanol-induced inhibition, respectively, in the ADH but not the FVB group. The ADH transgene also substantiated the ethanol-induced inhibition of maximal velocity of shortening/relengthening and unmasked an ethanol-induced prolongation of the duration of shortening/relengthening, which was abolished by 4-MP. These data suggest that elevated cardiac ACA exposure due to enhanced ADH expression may play an important role in the development of alcoholic cardiomyopathy.</ab>

<ab>The D4R gene of vaccinia virus encodes a functional uracil-DNA glycosylase that is essential for viral viability (D. T. Stuart, C. Upton, M. A. Higman, E. G. Niles, and G. McFadden, J. Virol. 67:2503-2513, 1993), and a D4R mutant, ts4149, confers a conditional lethal defect in viral DNA replication (A. K. Millns, M. S. Carpenter, and A. M. DeLange, Virology 198:504-513, 1994). The mutant ts4149 protein was expressed in vitro and assayed for uracil-DNA glycosylase activity. Less than 6% of wild-type activity was observed at permissive temperatures, but the ts4149 protein was completely inactive at the nonpermissive temperature. Mutagenesis of the ts4149 gene back to wild type (Arg-179--&amp;gt;Gly) restored full activity. The ts4149 protein was considerably reduced in lysates of cells infected at the permissive temperature, and its activity was undetectable, even in the presence of the uracil glycosylase inhibitor protein, which inhibits the host uracil-DNA glycosylases but not that of vaccinia virus. Thus the ts4149 protein is thermolabile, correlating uracil removal with vaccinia virus DNA replication. Three active-site amino acids of the vaccinia virus uracil-DNA glycosylase were mutated (Asp-68--&amp;gt;Asn, Asn-120--&amp;gt;Val, and His-181--&amp;gt;Leu), producing proteins that were completely defective in uracil excision but still retained the ability to bind DNA. Each mutated D4R gene was transfected into vaccinia virus ts4149-infected cells in order to assess the recombination events that allowed virus survival at 40 degrees C. Genetic analysis and sequencing studies revealed that the only viruses to survive were those in which recombination eliminated the mutant locus. We conclude that the uracil cleavage activity of the D4R protein is essential for its function in vaccinia virus DNA replication, suggesting that the removal of uracil residues plays an obligatory role.</ab>

<ab>The frequency of recombination between transfected plasmid DNAs was measured by using cultured cells infected with a variety of poxviruses. Plasmid derivatives of pBR322 containing XhoI linker insertion mutations in the tetracycline gene were used to assess recombination frequencies in rabbit cells infected with the leporipoxviruses Shope fibroma virus and myxoma virus and the orthopoxvirus vaccinia virus. Recombination frequencies were calculated by Southern blotting, which detects novel plasmid restriction fragments generated by genetic recombination, and by a plasmid rescue procedure in which the reconstruction of an intact tetracycline gene in the transfected rabbit cell was monitored by transformation back into Escherichia coli. The highest recombination frequencies were measured in cells infected with Shope fibroma virus and myxoma virus, and a minimum recombination frequency of at least one recombination event per 7 kilobases was calculated within 24 h posttransfection under these conditions. The deduced recombination frequency in vaccinia virus-infected cells was at least fivefold lower and was not detectable in mock-infected cells, suggesting that the induced recombination activity detected by these methods was under viral control. The results of kinetic studies, analysis with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, and the use of phosphonoacetic acid, a specific inhibitor of poxvirus DNA polymerase, indicated that recombination between transfecting DNAs occurred concomitantly with DNA replication but that the two processes could be partially uncoupled. We conclude that the dramatic expansion of recombination activities in the cytoplasm of poxvirus-infected cells is virus specific and offers a good model system with which to analyze the mechanism of recombination in a eucaryotic environment.</ab>

<ab>M11L, a novel 166-amino acid membrane-associated protein expressed by the poxvirus, myxoma virus, was previously found to modulate apoptosis after infection of rabbit leukocytes. Furthermore, infection of rabbits with an M11L knockout virus unexpectedly produced lesions with a profound proinflammatory phenotype. We show here that M11L is antiapoptotic when expressed independently of other viral proteins, and is directed specifically to mitochondria by a short COOH-terminal region that is necessary and sufficient for targeting. This targeting region consists of a hydrophobic domain flanked by basic amino acid residues, adjacent to a positively charged tail. M11L blocks staurosporine-induced apoptosis by preventing mitochondria from undergoing a permeability transition, and the mitochondrial localization of this protein is essential for this function. We show that M11L is specifically required to inhibit the apoptotic response of monocytes/macrophages during virus infection, as cells of this lineage undergo apoptosis when infected with the M11L knockout virus. As monocyte apoptosis is uniquely proinflammatory, we propose that this observation reconciles the paradoxical proapoptotic and proinflammatory phenotypes of the M11L knockout virus. We suggest that apoptosis of tissue macrophages represents an important antiviral defense, and that the inhibition of apoptosis by viral proteins can be directed in a cell-specific fashion.</ab>

<ab>M11L, an antiapoptotic protein essential for the virulence of the myxoma poxvirus, is targeted to mitochondria and prevents the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential that accompanies cell death. In this study we show, using a cross-linking approach, that M11L physically associates with the mitochondrial peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) component of the permeability transition (PT) pore. Close association of M11L and the PBR is also indicated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis. Stable expression of M11L prevents the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c induced by staurosporine or protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), a ligand of the PBR. Transiently expressed M11L also prevents mitochondrial membrane potential loss induced by PPIX, or induced by staurosporine in combination with PK11195, another ligand of the PBR. Myxoma virus infection and the associated expression of early proteins, including M11L, protects cells from staurosporine- and Fas-mediated mitochondrial membrane potential loss and this effect is augmented by the presence of PBR. We conclude that M11L regulates the mitochondrial permeability transition pore complex, most likely by direct modulation of the PBR.</ab>

<ab>Multicellular organisms possess very sophisticated defense mechanisms that are designed to effectively counter the continual microbial insult of the environment within the vertebrate host. However, successful microbial pathogens have in turn evolved complex and efficient methods to overcome innate and adaptive immune mechanisms, which can result in disease or chronic infections. Although the various virulence strategies used by viral and bacterial pathogens are numerous, there are several general mechanisms that are used to subvert and exploit immune systems that are shared between these diverse microbial pathogens. The success of each pathogen is directly dependant on its ability to mount an effective anti-immune response within the infected host, which can ultimately result in acute disease, chronic infection, or pathogen clearance. In this review, we highlight and compare some of the many molecular mechanisms that bacterial and viral pathogens use to evade host immune defenses.</ab>

<ab>In light of the recent detection of BSE in North America and its endemic nature in other regions of the world, there is a real need to employ cell culture conditions that do not require any animal-derived material. Here we report the use of an ultra-low protein serum-free medium (VP-SFM, Invitrogen) for the amplification of poxviruses in primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF). We compared the amplification of four different poxviruses (canarypox, modified Ankara Virus (MVA), vaccinia virus strain Copenhagen and myxoma strain Lausanne) in three different media: DMEM 10%, DMEM 2% and serum-free medium VP-SFM. VP-SFM is a serum-free, ultra-low protein medium containing no proteins or peptides of human or animal origin designed to support the replication of viruses and the production of recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies. Our results show that high titre poxvirus stocks can be prepared in VP-SFM equivalent to that prepared in serum containing medium.</ab>

<ab>Despite many advances in chemotherapy and other medical techniques, patients with cancer often develop local recurrence or metastatic spread. Recent advances in molecular biology and tumor immunology have led to the design of many new anti-tumor vaccines. Such approaches are now using recombinant viruses to treat different types of cancer. From these new developments, innovative fields are emerging: vaccine virotherapy, viral immunotherapy, oncolytic virotherapy and drug virotherapy. Many viruses are currently exploited as recombinant vectors and each offers natural or synthetic characteristics that may provide unique means to treat cancer. Poxviruses are large double stranded DNA viruses that offer many advantageous characteristics as recombinant vectors. Poxvirus-based vectors offer essentially unlimited possibilities for genetic manipulation due to the large size of their DNA and high degree of safety. Vaccinia virus, the prototype virus of the Orthopoxvirus genus that was extensively used to eradicate Smallpox, and other poxviruses are now being considered and used for the treatment of cancer. This review will cover their utilization as anti-cancer therapeutics by describing recent patents (2000-2005).</ab>

<ab>Immunomodulatory proteins encoded by the larger DNA viruses interact with a wide spectrum of immune effector molecules that regulate the antiviral response in the infected host. Here we show that certain poxviruses, including myxoma virus. Shope fibroma virus, rabbitpox virus, vaccinia virus (strain Lister), cowpox virus, and raccoonpox virus, express a new family of secreted proteins which interact with members of both the CC and CXC superfamilies of chemokines. However, swinepox virus and vaccinia virus (strain WR) do not express this activity Using a recombinant poxviruses, the myxoma M-T1 and rabbitpox virus 35kDa secreted proteins were identified as prototypic members of this family of chemokine binding proteins. Members of this T1/35kDa family of poxvirus-secreted proteins share multiple stretches of identical sequence motifs, including eight conserved cysteine residues, but are otherwise unrelated to any cellular genes in the database. The affinity of the CC chemokine RANTES interaction with M-T1 was assessed by Scatchard analysis and yielded a Kd of approximately 73 nM. In rabbits infected with a mutant rabbitpox virus, in which the 35kDa gene is deleted, there was an increased number of extravasating leukocytes in the deep dermis during the early phases of infection. These observations suggest that members of the T1/35kDa class of secreted viral proteins bind multiple members of the chemokine superfamily in vitro and modulate the influx of inflammatory cells into virus-infected tissues in vivo.</ab>

<ab>Myxoma virus (MYX) induces extensive immunosuppression in infected rabbits and is associated with high levels of mortality. The virus encodes multiple gene products designed to circumvent the cellular immune response to the viral infection. Deletion analysis has shown that the M11L open reading frame (ORF) is an important virulence factor which downregulates leukocyte infiltration of MYX-induced tumors. To investigate the role of the M11L protein in viral pathogenesis, we sequenced the MYX M11L ORF and showed that the sequence has motifs consistent with a 166-aa class III membrane-spanning molecule possessing a single transmembrane helix near the C-terminus and a 142-aa N-terminal extracellular domain that has six cysteine residues plus two consensus N-glycosylation sites. Transcription analysis indicates that M11L is expressed as an early gene, and surface immunofluorescence studies with anti-M11L antibodies reveal that M11L protein is transported to the infected cell surface. Immunoprecipitation analysis of an attenuated viral recombinant, vMYX-GF-delta M11L, indicates that an M11L variant protein with an altered C-terminus is synthesized at about 45% of wild type levels; however, it is not detectable on the cell surface, suggesting that proper M11L function requires localization at the infected cell membrane. We propose that M11L is a virulence factor whose function is to recognize an extracellular ligand essential for the cellular inflammatory response.</ab>

<ab>Succinyl-CoA synthetase [succinate-CoA ligase (GDP-forming); EC 6.2.1.4] of rat liver, an alpha beta dimer, is a component of the enzymology of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and functions within the mitochondrial matrix. We have isolated and determined the sequence of a cDNA clone containing the coding sequence of the cytoplasmic precursor to the alpha subunit of this enzyme together with stretches of nontranslated sequence at the 5&amp;#39; and 3&amp;#39; ends. The translated amino acid sequence indicates the presence of a 27-residue N-terminal signal sequence for mitochondrial targeting. The amino acid sequence of the mature alpha subunit shows an extraordinary degree of homology to the alpha subunit of Escherichia coli succinyl-CoA synthetase, with greater than 70% of the residues identical. This suggests that the fundamental differences in the quaternary structures and catalytic functions of the mammalian and bacterial enzymes must be attributable to differences in the beta subunits. mRNA that hybridizes to the cloned DNA is approximately equal to 1800 nucleotide residues in length, confirming that each of the two subunits is encoded separately and does not arise by proteolysis of a primary gene product containing both subunits of the mature protein.</ab>

<ab>The purpose of this study was to investigate the significance of the C-terminal RDEL motif of the myxoma virus M-T4 protein in terms of apoptosis regulation and role in viral virulence. To accomplish this, a recombinant myxoma virus was created in which the C-terminal RDEL motif of M-T4 was deleted and a selectable marker (Ecogpt) was inserted immediately downstream. We hypothesized that removal of the RDEL motif from M-T4 would alter the subcellular localization of the protein and provide insight into its antiapoptotic role. Surprisingly, removal of the RDEL motif from M-T4 did not affect localization of the protein within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but it did reduce the stability of the mutant protein. Pulse-chase immunoprecipitation and endoglycosidase H analysis coupled with confocal fluorescent light microscopy demonstrated that the M-T4 RDEL(-) mutant protein is retained in the ER like wildtype M-T4 and suggests that the C-terminal RDEL motif is not the sole determinant for M-T4 localization to the ER. Infection of cultured rabbit lymphocytes with the M-T4 RDEL(-) mutant virus results in an intermediate apoptosis phenotype compared with the wildtype and M-T4 knockout mutant viruses. A novel myxomatosis phenotype was observed in European rabbits when infected with the recombinant M-T4 RDEL(-) mutant virus. Rabbits infected with the M-T4 RDEL(-) virus on day 9 postinfection exhibited an exacerbated edematous and inflammatory response at secondary sites of infections, particularly the ears. Our results indicate that the C-terminal RDEL motif may not be solely responsible for retention of M-T4 to the ER and that M-T4 may have a dual function in protecting infected lymphocytes from apoptosis and in modulating the inflammatory response to virus infection.</ab>

<ab>BACKGROUND: Innate immunity provides obstacles to successful organ transplantation, which cannot be prevented by cyclosporine (CsA). Here we have determined the potential of a myxoma viral serpin, Serp-1, with proven anti-inflammatory and antiatherogenic actions, to modulate innate immunity and contribute synergistically with CsA in the prevention of acute cardiac allograft rejection. METHODS: Brown-Norway rat hearts were heterotopically transplanted into Lewis rats and given either a monotherapy treatment of Serp-1, a subtherapeutic dose of CsA, or the two drugs in combination. RESULTS: A brief treatment of Serp-1 alone, or a subtherapeutic dose of CsA, resulted in a marked decrease in intragraft macrophage infiltration and downregulation of toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, TLR4 and MyD88 at 48 hours posttransplantation, which was associated with significantly reduced numbers of mature dendritic cells. A significant reduction in intragraft T-lymphocyte infiltration was observed with both Serp-1 monotherapy and Serp-1 and CsA combination therapy, with the combination treatment achieving indefinite graft survival (&amp;gt;100 days) with normal histology. The CsA monotherapy group displayed partially reduced lymphocyte infiltration compared to the untreated controls, but failed to inhibit early innate immune graft recognition events such as macrophage infiltration and TLR 2, TLR4, and MyD88, and was ultimately unsuccessful in preventing rejection (36.3+/-7.8 days). CONCLUSION: Observed suppressive effects of Serp-1 on early innate immune response components such as TLR-2 and 4, and on adaptive responses such as T-cell intragraft infiltration suggests that Serp-1 may modulate the transition from innate to adaptive immunity, exhibiting a synergistic effect on allograft survival when used in combination with a subtherapeutic dose of CsA.</ab>

<ab>Subversion or appropriation of cellular signal transduction pathways is a common strategy employed by viruses to promote an environment within infected cells that supports the viral replicative cycle. Using subsets of 3T3 murine fibroblasts previously shown to differ in their ability to support myxoma virus (MV) replication, we investigated the role of host serine-threonine kinases (STKs) as potential mediators of the permissive phenotype. Both permissive and nonpermissive 3T3 cells supported equivalent levels of virion binding, entry, and early virus gene expression, indicating that MV tropism in 3T3 cells was not determined by receptor-mediated entry. In contrast, late virus gene expression and viral DNA replication were selectively compromised in restrictive 3T3 cells. Addition of specific protein kinase inhibitors, many of which shared the ability to influence the activity of the STKs p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK-1) and Raf-1 attenuated MV replication in permissive 3T3 cells. Western blot detection of the phosphorylated forms of PAK-1 (Thr423) and Raf-1 (Ser338) confirmed activation of these kinases in permissive cells after MV infection or gamma interferon treatment, but the activated forms of both kinases were greatly reduced or absent in restrictive 3T3 cells. The biological significance of these activations was demonstrated by using the autoinhibitory domain of PAK-1 (amino acids 83 to 149), expression of which reduced the efficiency of MV infection in permissive 3T3 cells concurrent with a decrease in PAK-1 activation. In comparison, overexpression of a constitutively active PAK-1 (T423E) mutant increased MV replication in restrictive 3T3 cells. These observations suggest that induced signaling via cellular STKs may play important roles in determining the permissiveness of host cells to poxvirus infection.</ab>

<ab>Proinflammatory caspases play an essential role in innate immune responses to infection by regulating the cleavage and activation of proinflammatory cytokines. Activation of these enzymes requires the assembly of an intracellular molecular platform, termed the inflammasome, which is comprised of members of the pyrin domain (PYD)-containing superfamily of apoptosis and inflammation-regulatory proteins. We report here the identification and characterization of a poxvirus-encoded PYD-containing protein that interacts with the ASC-1 component of the inflammasome and inhibits caspase-1 activation and the processing of IL-1beta and IL-18 induced by diverse stimuli. Knockout viruses that do not express this protein are unable to productively infect monocytes and lymphocytes due to an abortive phenotype and are markedly attenuated in susceptible hosts due to decreased virus dissemination and enhanced inflammatory responses at sites of infection. Thus, modulation of inflammasome function constitutes an important immunomodulatory strategy employed by poxviruses to circumvent host antiviral responses.</ab>

<ab>The study of viral pathogens with genomes as large and complex as poxviruses represents a constant experimental challenge. Advances in recombinant DNA technologies have provided sophisticated methods to produce mutants defective in one or more viral genes, termed knockout (KO) viruses, thereby facilitating research into the impact of specific gene products on viral pathogenesis. Such strategies have rapidly advanced the systematic mining of many poxvirus genomes and enabled researchers to identify and characterize poxvirus genes whose functions represent the culmination of host and pathogen coevolution. Of particular interest are the multiple classes of virus-encoded immunomodulatory proteins that have evolved specifically to allow poxviruses to evade, obstruct or subvert critical elements within the host innate and acquired immune responses. Functional characterization of these viral genes by generating KO viruses and investigating the phenotypic changes that result is an important tool for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying poxvirus replication and pathogenesis. Moreover, the insights gained have led to new developments in basic and clinical virology, provided a basis for the design of new vaccines and antivirals, and increased the potential application of poxviruses as investigative tools and sources of biotherapeutics for the treatment of human diseases.</ab>

<ab>Recent studies have indicated a critical role for interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral responses in the host range of myxoma virus (MV), a pathogenic poxvirus of rabbits. To investigate the contribution of IFN to MV tropism in nonleporine cells, primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) were tested for permissiveness to MV infection. Low-passage HDFs that underwent fewer than 25 population doublings (PD) were fully permissive for MV infection, supporting productive virus replication and cell-to-cell spread. In contrast, early and late viral gene expression was detectable in high-passage HDF (&amp;gt;75 PD), but MV failed to generate infectious progeny and could not form foci in these cells. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) plaque reduction assays confirmed that constitutive IFN production progressively increased as HDFs were passaged, concurrent with an increase in the expression of transcripts for type I IFN and IFN-responsive genes involved in antiviral responses. These findings correlated with the enhanced sensitivity of higher-passage HDF to inducers of type I IFN responses, such as dsRNA. Furthermore, pretreatment of low-passage HDF with type I IFN abrogated MV spread and replication while treatment of mature HDF with neutralizing antibodies to IFN-beta, but not IFN-alpha, restored the capacity to form foci. These findings emphasize the importance of post-entry events in determining the permissiveness of human cells to MV infection and support a critical role for innate type I IFN responses as key determinants of poxvirus host range and species restriction.</ab>

<ab>The innate immune system is a dynamic and complex network for recognizing and responding to cellular insult or tissue damage after infection or injury. The primary effector mechanism of innate immunity is the generation of acute and chronic inflammatory responses through regulation of the processing and activation of proinflammatory caspases, particularly caspase 1, and cytokines, most notably IL-1beta and IL-18. Inflammasomes, cytosolic multi-protein complexes that function as molecular scaffolds for caspase activation, have recently emerged as the pivotal mechanism by which host innate immune and inflammatory responses are regulated. In this review, we investigate the mechanisms by which inflammasomes are modulated, both by endogenous host systems and by microbial pathogens.</ab>

<ab>The myxoma virus (MV) M-T5 gene encodes an ankyrin repeat protein that is important for virus replication in cells from several species. Insight was gained into the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of M-T5 as a host range determinant when the cell cycle regulatory protein cullin-1 (cul-1) was identified as a cellular binding partner of M-T5 and found to colocalize with the protein in both nuclear and cytosolic compartments. Consistent with this interaction, infection with wild-type MV (vMyxlac) or a deletion mutant lacking M-T5 (vMyxT5KO) differentially altered cell cycle progression in a panel of permissive and nonpermissive cells. Cells infected with vMyxlac transitioned rapidly out of the G0/G1 phase and preferentially accumulated at the G2/M checkpoint, whereas infection with vMyxT5KO impeded progression through the cell cycle, resulting in a greater percentage of cells retained at G0/G1. Levels of the cul-1 substrate, p27/Kip-1, were selectively increased in cells infected with vMyxT5KO compared to vMyxlac, concurrent with decreased phosphorylation of p27/Kip-1 at Thr187 and decreased ubiquitination. Compared to cells infected with vMyxlac, cell death was increased in vMyxT5KO-infected cells following treatment with diverse stimuli known to induce cell cycle arrest, including infection itself, serum deprivation, and exposure to proteasome inhibitors or double-stranded RNA. Moreover, infection with vMyxlac, but not vMyxT5KO, was sufficient to overcome the G0/G1 arrest induced by these stimuli. These findings suggest that M-T5 regulates cell cycle progression at the G0/G1 checkpoint, thereby protecting infected cells from diverse innate host antiviral responses normally triggered by G0/G1 cell cycle arrest.</ab>

<ab>Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) accounts for the majority of primary malignant brain tumors and remains virtually incurable despite extensive surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Treatment difficulty is due to its exceptional infiltrative nature and proclivity to integrate into normal brain tissue. Long-term survivors are rare, and median survival for patients is about 1 year. Use of adult stem cells as cellular delivery vehicles for anticancer agents is a novel attractive therapeutic strategy. We hypothesized that adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) possess the ability to home and deliver myxoma virus to glioma cells and experimental gliomas. We infected ADSCs with vMyxgfp and found them to be permissive for myxoma virus replication. ADSCs supported single and multiple rounds of replication leading to productive infection. Further, we observed no significant impact on ADSC viability. We cocultured fluorescently labeled GBM cells with myxoma virus-infected ADSCs in three-dimensional assay and observed successful cross infection and concomitant cell death almost exclusively in GBM cells. In vivo orthotopic studies injected with vMyxgfp-ADSCs intracranially away from the tumor demonstrated that myxoma virus was delivered by ADSCs resulting in significant survival increase. Our data suggest that ADSCs are promising new carriers of oncolytic viruses, specifically myxoma virus, to brain tumors.</ab>

<ab>Myxoma virus causes the systemic disease myxomatosis in the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Originating in the South American rabbit Sylvilagus brasiliensis, where it causes a relatively localized fibroma, myxoma virus is a classic example of a virus that has jumped species to produce an exotic disease and then coevolved with its new host. Like other poxviruses, myxoma virus encodes multiple proteins capable of downregulating the host innate and acquired immune responses. Other virus-encoded proteins enable replication in host lymphocytes and monocytes, for example, by inhibiting apoptosis. Detailed studies on these proteins have demonstrated novel methods of interactions with the host immune system and added substantially to the understanding of the interaction of large DNA viruses with their hosts. Despite the increasingly detailed molecular knowledge of myxoma virus, relatively little is known about the dynamics of the interaction of the virus with the integrated host-immune system during infection and, in particular, about the evolution of resistance to the virus in wild rabbits or the species barrier. This review will focus on the detailed molecular studies that have been done with myxoma virus and discuss the more limited knowledge of the pathogenesis of myxoma virus in rabbits and the ways that the consolidated immune responses may determine genetic resistance to myxomatosis.</ab>

<t1>The viral tropism of two distinct oncolytic viruses, reovirus and myxoma virus, is modulated by cellular tumor suppressor gene status</t1>

<ab>Replication-competent oncolytic viruses hold great potential for the clinical treatment of many cancers. Importantly, many oncolytic virus candidates, such as reovirus and myxoma virus, preferentially infect cancer cells bearing abnormal cellular signaling pathways. Reovirus and myxoma virus are highly responsive to activated Ras and Akt signaling pathways, respectively, for their specificity for viral oncolysis. However, considering the complexity of cancer cell populations, it is possible that other tumor-specific signaling pathways may also contribute to viral discrimination between normal versus cancer cells. Because carcinogenesis is a multistep process involving the accumulation of both oncogene activations and the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, we speculated that not only oncogenes but also tumor suppressor genes may have an important role in determining the tropism of these viruses for cancer cells. It has been previously shown that many cellular tumor suppressor genes, such as p53, ATM and Rb, are important for maintaining genomic stability; dysfunction of these tumor suppressors may disrupt intact cellular antiviral activity due to the accumulation of genomic instability or due to interference with apoptotic signaling. Therefore, we speculated that cells with dysfunctional tumor suppressors may display enhanced susceptibility to challenge with these oncolytic viruses, as previously seen with adenovirus. We report here that both reovirus and myxoma virus preferentially infect cancer cells bearing dysfunctional or deleted p53, ATM and Rb tumor suppressor genes compared to cells retaining normal counterparts of these genes. Thus, oncolysis by these viruses may be influenced by both oncogenic activation and tumor suppressor status.Oncogene advance online publication, 17 May 2010; doi:10.1038/onc.2010.137.</ab>

<ab>Chemokines are crucial effector molecules involved in orchestrating the host inflammatory response against invading pathogens. Viruses have devised several strategies for exploiting or neutralizing chemokines or their receptors to further their own propagation or elude host defenses. Insight into strategies used by viruses to modulate chemokines might help generate novel approaches for treating viral diseases and chemokine-mediated inflammatory disorders.</ab>

<ab>The myxoma virus T7 protein M-T7 is a functional soluble gamma interferon receptor homolog that has previously been shown to bind gamma interferon and inhibit its antiviral activities in a species-specific manner, but gene knockout analysis has suggested a further role for M-T7 in blocking leukocyte influx into infected lesions. We purified M-T7 to apparent homogeneity and showed that M-T7 is an N-linked glycoprotein that appears to be a stable homotrimer with a molecular mass of approximately 113 kDa in solution. M-T7, in addition to forming inhibitory complexes with rabbit gamma interferon, was also shown to bind to human interleukin-8, a prototypic member of the chemokine superfamily. Moreover, M-T7 was able to interact promiscuously with all members of the CXC, CC, and C chemokine subfamilies tested. Binding of human RANTES to M-T7 can be competed by rabbit gamma interferon and also by cold RANTES competitor with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 900 nM. Although M-T7 retains binding to a number of interleukin-8 N-terminal (ELR) deletion mutants, binding to mutants containing deletions in the C-terminal heparin-binding domain of interleukin-8 is abrogated. Furthermore, heparin effectively competes the interaction of M-T7 with the chemokine RANTES but not with rabbit gamma interferon. We propose that this novel M-T7 interaction with members of the chemokine superfamily may be facilitated through the conserved heparin-binding domains found in a wide spectrum of chemokines and that M-T7 may function by modulating chemokine-glycosaminoglycan interactions in virus-infected tissues.</ab>

<ab>Myxoma virus is a poxvirus that causes a virulent systemic disease called myxomatosis in European rabbits. Like many poxviruses, myxoma virus encodes a variety of secreted proteins that subvert the antiviral activities of host cytokines. It was recently demonstrated that the myxoma virus M-T1 glycoprotein is a member of a large poxvirus family of secreted proteins that bind CC-chemokines and inhibit their chemoattractant activities in vitro. To determine the biological role of M-T1 in contributing to myxoma virus virulence, we constructed a recombinant M-T1-deletion mutant virus that was defective in M-T1 expression. Here, we demonstrate that M-T1 is expressed continuously during the course of myxoma virus infection as a highly stable 43-kDa glycoprotein and is dispensable for virus replication in vitro. Deletion of M-T1 had no significant effects on disease progression or in the overall mortality rate of infected European rabbits but heightened the localized cellular inflammation in primary tissue sites during the initial 2 to 3 days of infection. In the absence of M-T1 expression, deep dermal tissues surrounding the primary site of virus inoculation showed a dramatic increase in infiltrating leukocytes, particularly monocytes/macrophages, but these phagocytes remained relatively ineffective at clearing virus infection, likely due to the concerted properties of other secreted myxoma virus proteins. We conclude that M-T1 inhibits the chemotactic signals required for the influx of monocytes/macrophages during the acute-phase response of myxoma virus infection in vivo, as predicted by its ability to bind and inhibit CC-chemokines in vitro.</ab>

<ab>Chemokine receptors serve as portals of entry for certain intracellular pathogens, most notably human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Myxoma virus is a member of the poxvirus family that induces a lethal systemic disease in rabbits, but no poxvirus receptor has ever been defined. Rodent fibroblasts (3T3) that cannot be infected with myxoma virus could be made fully permissive for myxoma virus infection by expression of any one of several human chemokine receptors, including CCR1, CCR5, and CXCR4. Conversely, infection of 3T3-CCR5 cells can be inhibited by RANTES, anti-CCR5 polyclonal antibody, or herbimycin A but not by monoclonal antibodies that block HIV-1 infection or by pertussis toxin. These findings suggest that poxviruses, like HIV, are able to use chemokine receptors to infect specific cell subtypes, notably migratory leukocytes, but that their mechanisms of receptor interactions are distinct.</ab>

<ab>Chemokines and chemokine receptors play a critical role in the host defense against viruses by mobilizing leukocytes to sites of infection, injury and inflammation. In order to replicate successfully within their host organisms, viruses have devised novel strategies for exploiting or subverting chemokine networks. This review summarizes various mechanisms that are currently known to be used by viruses for modulating chemokine activities including viral homologs of chemokines and chemokine receptors and soluble viral chemokine binding proteins. Insight into these strategies is providing a wealth of information on viral-host interactions, the function of chemokines in host defense and may help to generate novel anti-chemokine agents for treating against viral diseases or inflammatory disorders.</ab>

<ab>Poxviruses encode a variety of immunomodulatory proteins that subvert the cytokine networks of infected hosts. Myxoma virus, a poxvirus pathogen of rabbits, expresses two distinct 35- to 40-kDa secreted glycoproteins that bind a broad spectrum of chemokines. The first of these, designated M-T7, is encoded by the T7 gene and is the first example of what is here referred to as type-I chemokine binding protein (CBP-I). M-T7 was initially discovered as a secreted viral homologue of cellular interferon-gamma receptor but binding studies indicate that purified M-T7 protein also interacts with members of the CXC, CC, and C chemokine families through the conserved heparin-binding domains. The second myxoma protein, M-T1, also called CBP-II, is a member of a larger superfamily of poxvirus proteins that includes related secreted 35-kDa proteins encoded by a wide variety of orthopoxviruses. Deletion analysis of either CBP-I or -II genes within recombinant poxvirus constructs revealed profound alterations in the trafficking of infiltrating leukocytes into virus-infected lesions. It is proposed that the interaction of CBP-I with the conserved heparin-binding domains found on most chemokines represents a novel mechanism for altering multiple chemokine functions in vivo. In summary, CBP-I and CBP-II are the first examples of secreted virus proteins that bind to multiple chemokine family members as part of a strategy to prevent the early phase of inflammatory cell migration into virus-infected tissues.</ab>

<ab>Many poxviruses express a 35-40-kDa secreted protein, termed &amp;quot;T1&amp;quot; (for leporipoxviruses) or &amp;quot;35kDa&amp;quot; (for orthopoxviruses), that binds CC-chemokines with high affinity but is unrelated to any known cellular proteins. Many previously identified poxvirus cytokine-binding proteins display strict species ligand-binding specificity. Because the T1 and 35kDa proteins share only 40% amino acid identity, we compared the abilities of purified myxoma virus-T1 (M-T1) and vaccinia virus (strain Lister)- and rabbitpox virus-35kDa proteins to inhibit human CC-chemokines in vitro. All three proteins were equally effective in preventing several human CC-chemokines from binding to target chemokine receptors and blocking subsequent intracellular calcium release. The inhibitory affinities were comparable (Ki = 0.07-1.02 nM). These proteins also displayed similar abilities to inhibit (IC50 = 6.3-10.5 nM) human macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha-mediated chemotaxis of human monocytes. None of the viral proteins blocked interleukin-8-mediated calcium flux or chemotaxis of human neutrophils, confirming that the biological specificity of the T1/35kDa family is targeted inhibition of CC-chemokines. Despite the significant sequence divergence between the leporipoxvirus T1 and orthopoxvirus 35kDa proteins, our data suggest that their CC-chemokine binding and inhibitory properties appear to be species nonspecific and that the critical motifs most likely reside within the limited regions of conservation.</ab>

<ab>Serine protease inhibitors (serpins) regulate coagulation and inflammation. Heparin, a glycosaminoglycan, is an important cofactor for modulation of the inhibitory function of mammalian serpins. The secreted myxoma viral serpin, Serp-1 exerts profound anti-inflammatory activity in a wide range of animal models. Serp-1 anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic activity is dependent upon inhibition of the uPA / uPA receptor thrombolytic complex. We demonstrate here that heparin binds to Serp-1 and enhances Serp-1 inhibition of thrombin, a human pro-thrombotic serine protease, in vitro, altering inhibitory activity to a more predominant anti-thrombotic activity. Heparin also facilitates the simultaneous thrombin-mediated cleavage of Serp-1 and prevents formation of a serpin-typical SDS-resistant complex, implying mutual neutralization of Serp-1 and thrombin. In a cell-based assay, heparin facilitates Serp-1 reversal of cellular activation by stabilizing cellular membrane fluidity in thrombin-activated monocytes. In conclusion, heparin and other GAGs serve as cofactors enhancing Serp-1 regulation of local thrombotic and inflammatory pathways.</ab>

<ab>Myxoma virus (MYXV) is a poxvirus pathogenic only for European rabbits, but its permissiveness in human cancer cells gives it potential as an oncolytic virus. A recombinant MYXV expressing both the tdTomato red fluorescent protein and interleukin-15 (IL-15) (vMyx-IL-15-tdTr) was constructed. Cells infected with vMyx-IL-15-tdTr secreted bioactive IL-15 and had in vitro replication kinetics similar to that of wild-type MYXV. To determine the safety of this virus for future oncolytic studies, we tested its pathogenesis in European rabbits. In vivo, vMyx-IL-15-tdTr no longer causes lethal myxomatosis. Thus, ectopic IL-15 functions as an antiviral cytokine in vivo, and vMyx-IL-15-tdTr is a safe candidate for animal studies of oncolytic virotherapy.</ab>

<ab>BACKGROUND: Both CC and CXC chemokines direct monocyte and T-cell migration and activation at sites of vascular injury, but the relative contributions of each chemokine class to transplant vasculopathy development have not been defined. The nonselective C, CC, and CXC chemokine binding protein, M-T7, inhibits vasculopathy development after angioplasty and after renal transplant. We have assessed the effects of three viral chemokine-binding proteins with differing ranges of chemokine inhibition on plaque growth in rats after aortic allograft transplant. METHODS: One of two myxomaviral chemokine binding proteins, (1). M-T1, a selective CC chemokine inhibitor, or (2). M-T7, a nonselective chemokine-binding protein, was given immediately after transplant. A separate group was treated with the gamma68-herpesvirus protein, M3, a C, CC, CXC, and CX3C binding protein, with preferential CC binding. RESULTS: Intimal hyperplasia was significantly reduced at late times posttransplant after infusion of each chemokine-binding protein (P &amp;lt;0.05). Early inhibition of macrophage and T-cell invasion was associated with a late decrease in vasculopathy development. Infusion of an inactive myxomavirus protein did not inhibit plaque growth. Combined high-dose M-T1 and M-T7 did not reduce plaque growth or early cell invasion to a greater extent than either protein alone. Coinfusion of the CC chemokines macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha neutralized M-T1 and M-T7 inhibition of monocyte invasion, respectively, suggesting a key role for CC chemokine-mediated cellular influx. CONCLUSION: Viral chemokine-modulating proteins effectively reduce aortic allograft vasculopathy, acting predominantly through inhibition of a CC chemokine-mediated response.</ab>

<ab>Chemokines and IFN-gamma function as central regulators of inflammatory responses to vascular injury. Both classes of cytokines are upregulated during restenosis, a response to vascular injury that leads to recurrent atherosclerotic plaque growth, but the relative impact of each class of cytokines remains undetermined. M-T7 is a secreted myxoma viral immunomodulatory glycoprotein that functions both as a species-specific inhibitor of rabbit IFN-gamma and as a chemokine-binding protein, interacting with a wide range of C, C-C, and C-X-C chemokines in a species-nonspecific fashion. We wished to (a) assess the efficacy of purified M-T7 protein in inhibiting intimal hyperplasia after angioplasty injury and (b) exploit unique species-specific functions of M-T7 in order to judge the relative importance of each cytokine class on plaque growth. Anesthetized New Zealand white rabbits and Sprague-Dawley rats received either M-T7 or control at the time of arterial angioplasty injury. Histological analysis at 28 days demonstrated significant reductions in intimal hyperplasia with M-T7 treatment in both models, with an associated early inhibition of inflammatory cell invasion. Purified M-T7 protein inhibits intimal hyperplasia after angioplasty injury in a species-nonspecific fashion, thus implicating the chemokine-binding activity as more critical for prevention of plaque growth after vascular injury.</ab>

<ab>The expression of two serine proteases is induced by antigenic stimulation in cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Using nuclear run-on analysis the increase in steady state mRNA level has been shown to correspond to transcriptional activation. However, the two genes appear to be sequentially rather than coordinately induced. Both genes were shown to be more sensitive to DNase I digestion than a beta-globin gene in cytotoxic T cells. In addition, for the cytotoxic cell protease 1 gene the 5&amp;#39; region of the gene was more sensitive than the 3&amp;#39; end. Two DNaseI hypersensitive sites were seen in the 5&amp;#39; flanking sequences of both genes. The DNA sequences of the upstream regions of both genes were determined and compared. Although the two flanking sequences are overall quite dissimilar, there are short regions which are shared between the two CTL-protease genes. A number of these have been implicated in regulating the expression of other T cell genes.</ab>

Similarly to other serine protease genes, each of the active-site residues is contained on a separate exon; however, two introns were found in particularly interesting positions. One occurs within the postulated activation dipeptide and the other in a position close to the active-site Asp residue. This latter intron interrupts the amino acid sequence in the invariant core region of the protein. We believe that these genes represent a new subfamily of serine protease genes.</ab>

<ab>The myxoma and malignant rabbit fibroma poxviruses are lethal tumorigenic viruses of rabbits whose virulence is modulated by the production of a virus-encoded secreted serine proteinase inhibitor, SERP-1. This viral protein was detected in medium harvested from myxoma and malignant rabbit fibroma virus-infected cells, and its inhibitory profile has been characterized by gel and kinetic analysis. SERP-1 forms complexes with and inhibits the human fibrinolytic enzymes plasmin, urokinase, and two-chain tissue-type plasminogen activator (association rate constants 3.4 x 10(4), 4.3 x 10(4), and 3.6 x 10(4) M-1 s-1 respectively). It is also able to inhibit C1S, the first enzyme in the complement cascade with an association rate constant which was unaffected by the addition of heparin (1.3 x 10(3) M-1 s-1). SERP-1 acts as a substrate for and is cleaved by thrombin, porcine trypsin, human neutrophil elastase, porcine pancreatic elastase, thermolysin, subtilisin, bovine alpha-chymotrypsin, and factor Xa. Incubation with kallikrein and cathepsin G had no effect. The structure of SERP-1 has been modeled on other members of the serpin family which revealed the characteristic serpin architecture apart from the absence of the D-helix. Structural analysis and kinetic assays demonstrate that the absence of this region does not prevent inhibitory activity and furthermore allow the identification of cysteine residues involved in internal and intermolecular disulfide bonding.</ab>

<ab>BACKGROUND: Surgical and ischemic injury to the artery wall initiates vascular wound-healing responses that stimulate atherosclerotic plaque growth. The plasminogen activators have cellular chemotactic, adhesion, and proteolytic activity. Serp-1 is a secreted myxoma virus glycoprotein serpin that binds and inhibits plasminogen activators. We have examined the effects of Serp-1 on plaque growth and inflammatory cell invasion in animal models after balloon injury and after aortic allograft transplant. METHODS: We used histologic analysis to assess 4 animal models of angioplasty-mediated injury and 2 models of aortic allograft transplant for intimal hyperplasia and cellular invasion. We assessed plasminogen activator (uPA and tPA) and inhibitor (PAI-1) expression in rat iliofemoral arteries after balloon injury using Western blot, enzyme activity, and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Plaque growth after balloon injury decreased after Serp-1 treatment in all balloon-injury models tested. Transplant vasculopathy also significantly decreased in 2 rat models of aortic allograft transplant. Infusion of a Serp-1 active site mutant, that lacked plasminogen activator inhibiting activity, did not inhibit plaque growth. Quantitative RT-PCR detected increased transcription of PAI-1 mRNA. Increased PAI-1 protein and enzyme-inhibitory activity was also detected in Serp-1-treated arteries by activity assay and Western blot. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombolytic serpins are central regulatory agents in vascular wound-healing responses. Investigation of the inhibitory mechanisms of viral serpins may provide new insights into atherogenesis.</ab>

<ab>Serine proteinase inhibitors, also called serpins, are an ancient grouping of proteins found in primitive organisms from bacteria, protozoa and horseshoe crabs and thus likely present at the time of the dinosaurs, up to all mammals living today. The innate or inflammatory immune system is also an ancient metazoan regulatory system, providing the first line of defense against infection or injury. The innate inflammatory defense response evolved long before acquired, antibody dependent immunity. Viruses have developed highly effective stratagems that undermine and block a wide variety of host inflammatory and immune responses. Some of the most potent of these immune modifying strategies utilize serpins that have also been developed over millions of years, including the hijacking by some viruses for defense against host immune attacks. Serpins represent up to 2-10 percent of circulating plasma proteins, regulating actions as wide ranging as thrombosis, inflammation, blood pressure control and even hormone transport. Targeting serpin-regulated immune or inflammatory pathways makes evolutionary sense for viral defense and many of these virus-derived inhibitory proteins have proven to be highly effective, working at very low concentrations--even down to the femptomolar to picomolar range. We are studying these viral anti-inflammatory proteins as a new class of immunomodulatory therapeutic agents derived from their native viral source. One such viral serpin, Serp-1 is now in clinical trial (conducted by VIRON Therapeutics, Inc.) for acute unstable coronary syndromes (unstable angina and small heart attacks), representing a &amp;#39;first in class&amp;#39; therapeutic study. Several other viral serpins are also currently under investigation as anti-inflammatory or anti-immune therapeutics. This chapter describes these original studies and the ongoing analysis of viral serpins as a new class of virus-derived immunotherapeutic.</ab>

<ab>BACKGROUND: Recurrent atherosclerotic plaque growth, restenosis, is a significant clinical problem after interventional procedures. Initiation of restenosis involves activation of inflammatory and thrombotic cascades, which are regulated by serine proteinase enzymes and inhibitors. We have investigated the use of a viral serine proteinase inhibitor, SERP-1, to reduce plaque development after primary balloon angioplasty. This is the first experimental report of the use of a viral anti-inflammatory protein for the prevention of atherosclerosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy-four cholesterol-fed rabbits were treated with either local or systemic infusions of SERP-1 protein (or control solutions) after balloon-mediated injury. Sites of SERP-1 infusion in rabbits had dramatically reduced plaque compared with control infusions at the 4-week follow-up. At low-dose infusions (30 to 300 pg), only the primary infusion site had a demonstrable decrease in plaque, whereas at higher-dose infusions (&amp;gt; 3000 pg), a generalized reduction in plaque development was detected. An associated decrease in mononuclear cell infiltration of the arterial wall was detected after SERP-1 infusion within the first 24 hours. Infusion of an active-site mutant of SERP-1 (P1-P1&amp;#39;, ala-ala) lacking serine proteinase inhibitory activity failed to prevent plaque growth. CONCLUSIONS: Purified SERP-1, a virus-encoded secreted glycoprotein, reduces plaque growth after primary balloon-mediated injury. Plaque development is decreased by inhibition of serine proteinase activity and is associated with a focal reduction in macrophage infiltration immediately after injury. Investigation of serine proteinase inhibitors may provide new insight into the regulation of arterial responses to injury.</ab>

<ab>Many viruses have learned to evade or subvert the host antiviral immune responses by encoding and expressing immunomodulatory proteins that protect the virus from attack by elements of the innate and acquired immune systems. Some of these viral anti-immune regulators are expressed as secreted proteins that engage specific host immune targets in the extracellular environment, where they exhibit potent anti-immune properties. We review here viral immunomodulatory proteins that have been tested as anti-inflammatory reagents in animal models of disease caused by excessive inflammation or hyperactivated immune pathways. The potential for such viral molecules for the development of novel drugs to treat immune-based or inflammatory disorders is discussed.</ab>

<ab>Oncolytic myxoma virus (MYXV) is being developed as a novel virotherapeutic against human brain cancer and has promising activity against human brain tumor models in immunocompromised hosts. Because an intact immune system could reduce its efficacy, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the oncolytic potential of MYXV in immunocompetent racine glioma models. Here, we report that MYXV infects and kills all racine cell glioma lines and that its effects are enhanced by rapamycin. Intratumoral administration of MYXV with rapamycin improved viral replication in the tumor and significantly prolonged host survival. Similarly, coadministration via a method of convection-enhanced delivery (CED) enhanced viral replication and efficacy in vivo. Mechanisms by which rapamycin improved MYXV oncolysis included an inhibition of type I IFN production in vitro and a reduction of intratumoral infiltration of CD68(+) microglia/macrophages and CD163(+) macrophages in vivo. Our findings define a method to improve MYXV efficacy against gliomas by rapamycin coadministration, which acts to promote immune responses engaged by viral delivery.</ab>

<ab>Myxoma virus, a poxvirus previously considered rabbit specific, can replicate productively in a variety of human tumor cells in culture. The purpose of this study was to determine if there was efficacy or toxicities of this oncolytic virus against experimental models of human malignant gliomas in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo in malignant glioma specimens. In vitro, the majority of glioma cell lines tested (7 of 8, 87.5%) were fully permissive for myxoma virus replication and killed by infection. In vivo, intracerebral (i.c.) myxoma virus inoculation was well tolerated and produced only minimal focal inflammatory changes at the site of viral inoculation. U87 and U251 orthotopic xenograft models were used to assess myxoma virus efficacy in vivo. A single intratumoral injection of myxoma virus dramatically prolonged median survival compared with treatment with UV-inactivated myxoma virus. Median survival was not reached in myxoma virus-treated groups versus 47.3 days (U87; P = 0.0002) and 50.7 days (U251; P = 0.0027) in UV-inactivated myxoma virus-treated groups. Most myxoma virus-treated animals (12 of 13, 92%) were alive and apparently &amp;quot;cured&amp;quot; when the experiment was finished (&amp;gt;130 days). Interestingly, we found a selective and long-lived myxoma virus infection in gliomas in vivo. This is the first demonstration of the oncolytic activity of myxoma virus in vivo. The nonpathogenic nature of myxoma virus outside of the rabbit host, its capacity to be genetically modified, its ability to produce a long-lived infection in human tumor cells, and the lack of preexisting antibodies in the human population suggest that myxoma virus may be an attractive oncolytic agent against human malignant glioma.</ab>

<ab>We have shown previously the oncolytic potential of myxoma virus in a murine xenograft model of human glioma. Here, we show that myxoma virus used alone or in combination with rapamycin is effective and safe when used in experimental models of medulloblastoma in vitro and in vivo. Nine of 10 medulloblastoma cell lines tested were susceptible to lethal myxoma virus infection, and pretreatment of cells with rapamycin increased the extent of in vitro oncolysis. Intratumoral injection of live myxoma virus when compared with control inactivated virus prolonged survival in D341 and Daoy orthotopic human medulloblastoma xenograft mouse models [D341 median survival: 21 versus 12.5 days; P = 0.0008; Daoy median survival: not reached (three of five mice apparently &amp;quot;cured&amp;quot; after 223 days) versus 75 days; P = 0.0021]. Rapamycin increased the extent of viral oncolysis, &amp;quot;curing&amp;quot; most Daoy tumor-bearing mice and reducing or eliminating spinal cord and ventricle metastases. Rapamycin enhanced tumor-specific myxoma virus replication in vivo and prolonged survival of D341 tumor-bearing mice (median survival of mice treated with live virus (LV) and rapamycin, versus LV alone, versus rapamycin alone, versus inactivated virus: 25 days versus 19, 13, and 11 days, respectively; P &amp;lt; 0.0001). Rapamycin increased the levels of constitutively activated Akt in Daoy and D341 cells, which may explain its ability to enhance myxoma virus oncolysis. These observations suggest that myxoma virus may be an effective oncolytic agent against medulloblastoma and that combination therapy with signaling inhibitors that modulate activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway will further enhance the oncolytic potential of myxoma virus.</ab>

<ab>A strong early promoter from the T1 open reading frame (ORF) within the terminal inverted repeat (TIR) of Shope fibroma virus (SFV) has been isolated and characterized. Promoter activity was determined by a transient gene expression assay in poxvirus-infected cells using the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase as a reporter gene. The sequences which constitute the boundaries of the promoter element were determined by 5&amp;#39; and 3&amp;#39; deletion analysis. The functional SFV T1 promoter domain comprises about 28 bp and includes, in addition to the transcriptional initiation site, a stretch of eight continuous A residues from position -18 to -11 which is critical for promoter function. Both the SFV T1 promoter and the vaccinia 7.5-kDa early/late promoter are active in the transient expression assay when the cells are infected with either the leporipoxvirus SFV or the orthopoxvirus vaccinia. To look more closely at the conservation of promoter function between poxvirus genera, a recombinant vaccinia virus containing the CAT gene driven by the SFV T1 promoter and a recombinant SFV containing the CAT gene driven by the vaccinia 7.5-kDa early/late promoters was constructed. The SFV T1 promoter behaves as an early promoter in the vaccinia genome, and both the T1 and the 7.5-kDa early/late promoters use transcriptional initiation sites in their heterologous genomic environment that are identical to the ones used in the native viral genome. The results from this work indicate that despite the relative lack of absolute sequence conservation, the transcriptional machinery, at least with respect to temporal regulation of early promoters and the position of transcript initiation, is conserved between these two poxvirus genera.</ab>

<ab>A composite transcriptional map for the entire 12.4-kb terminal inverted repeat (TIR) region of the Shope fibroma virus (SFV) genome has been determined. Northern blotting and S1-nuclease mapping were used to determine the regions which are transcribed, their temporal relationships, as well as the transcriptional initiation sites. Sequences representing the entire TIR are transcribed into poly(A)+ mRNA at both early and late times in the infection. Fifteen transcriptional initiation sites were mapped, 12 within the TIRs and 3 within the unique sequences close to the junction between the right TIR and the unique internal sequences. Ten of the 12 transcriptional initiation sites within the TIR and 2 of the 3 sites outside the right TIR correspond to the 5&amp;#39;-ends of the major open reading frames (ORFs) T1 to T9 plus the SFV growth factor gene. The 3 other initiation sites map within ORFs but near potential start codons for shorter polypeptides. All the expressed ORFs are tandemly arranged and transcribed toward the hairpin terminus. At early times during SFV infection of cultured rabbit cells, transcription of each ORF gives rise to a transcript of distinct size, while at late times termination of transcription is imprecise and substantial read-through into downstream sequences occurs. These results are discussed in light of recent observations on the related recombinant leporipoxvirus, malignant rabbit fibroma virus, which suggest that one or more gene products from this region of the SFV genome are implicated in viral tumorigenicity.</ab>

<ab>Cytotoxic T lymphocytes are important effectors of antiviral immunity, and they induce target cell death either by secretion of cytoplasmic granules containing perforin and granzymes or by signaling through the Fas cell surface antigen. Although it is not known whether the granule-mediated and Fas-mediated cytolytic mechanisms share common components, proteinase activity has been implicated as an important feature of both pathways. The orthopoxviruses cowpox virus and rabbitpox virus each encode three members of the serpin family of proteinase inhibitors, designated SPI-1, SPI-2, and SPI-3. Of these, SPI-2 (also referred to as cytokine response modifier A in cowpox virus) has been shown to inhibit the proteolytic activity of both members of the interleukin 1 beta converting enzyme family and granzyme B. We report here that cells infected with cowpox or rabbitpox viruses exhibit resistance to cytolysis by either cytolytic mechanism. Whereas mutation of the cytokine response modifier A/SPI-2 gene was necessary to relieve inhibition of Fasmediated cytolysis, in some cell types mutation of SPI-1, in addition to cytokine response modifier A/SPI-2, was necessary to completely abrogate inhibition. In contrast, viral inhibition of granule-mediated killing was unaffected by mutation of cytokine response modifier A/SPI-2 alone, and it was relieved only when both the cytokine response modifier A/SPI-2 and SPI-1 genes were inactivated. These results suggest that an interleukin 1 beta converting enzyme-like enzymatic activity is involved in both killing mechanisms and indicate that two viral proteins, SPI-1 and cytokine response modifier A/SPI-2, are necessary to inhibit both cytolysis pathways.</ab>

<ab>Myxoma virus is a leporipoxvirus that causes a highly lethal virulent disease known as myxomatosis in the European rabbit. An important aspect of myxoma virus pathogenesis is the ability of the virus to productively infect lymphocytes and spread to secondary sites via lymphatic channels. We investigated the infection of the CD4+ T lymphoma cell line RL-5 with myxoma virus and Shope fibroma virus, a related but benign leporipoxvirus, and observed that myxoma virus, but not Shope fibroma virus, was able to productively infect RL-5 cells. We also discovered that infection of RL-5 cells with Shope fibroma virus or attenuated myxoma virus mutants containing disruptions in either the T2 or the M11L gene resulted in the rapid induction of DNA fragmentation, followed by morphological changes and loss in cell integrity characteristic of cell death by apoptosis. Purified exogenous T2 protein was unable to prevent apoptosis, suggesting that T2 functions intracellularly. Thus, myxoma virus T2, originally described as a secreted homologue of the tumor necrosis factor receptor, and M11L, a novel transmembrane species with no known cellular homologue, function to extend virus host range for replication in rabbit T lymphocytes through the inhibition of apoptosis in infected T lymphocytes.</ab>

<ab>Myxoma virus is a leporipoxvirus that causes a rapidly lethal, generalized infection known as myxomatosis in the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). A characteristic feature of myxomatosis is the specific downregulation of key pathways important for numerous host defenses against the viral infection. The SERP1 gene has significant sequence similarity to the serpin superfamily of serine proteinase inhibitors and is one of many virulence factor genes located within the terminal regions of the myxoma virus genome. Transcriptional analysis of the SERP1 gene in myxoma virus (strain Lausanne) indicates that it is expressed as a late gene and studies using a polyclonal anti-SERP1 antiserum indicate that it encodes a secreted protein with an apparent molecular weight of 55 kDa. Using myxoma virus and recombinant vaccinia virus constructs for experiments with tunicamycin and peptide N-glycosidase F, it is shown that the secreted SERP1 protein is modified by N-linked glycosylation. Mutation of both copies of the SERP1 gene in myxoma virus results in a significant attenuation of the virus, such that more than 50% of infected animals are able to recover from the otherwise lethal infection. Histological analyses of lesions taken from infected animals suggest that in the absence of the SERP1 protein, a more effective inflammatory response occurs, allowing a more rapid resolution of the infection. This suggests that SERP1 contributes to viral pathogenesis by interacting with cellular component(s) involved in the regulation of inflammation.</ab>

<ab>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of intraarticular administration of SERP-1 protein, a myxoma virus derived antiinflammatory serine protease inhibitor, in an antigen induced arthritis (AIA) model of chronic inflammation. METHODS: AIA was induced in a single joint of 15 rabbits after intraarticular (i.a.) injection of ovalbumin in animals previously immunized to the same agent administered in complete Freund&amp;#39;s adjuvant. A 2nd i.a. injection of ovalbumin was given 2 weeks later preceded by 2 daily injections of human transforming growth factor-beta 2. SERP-1 was given by i.a. injection at 2 and 4 weeks after the last i.a. injection of ovalbumin. Three synovial specimens per joint were obtained for synovial histology. Patellar articular cartilage was assessed for collagen integrity and proteoglycan staining. RESULTS: Synovial histology revealed significant diminution in synovial lining cellular hyperplasia, chronic inflammatory infiltration, and cartilage erosion in treated animals, particularly in those receiving 2 i.a. injections of 1 ng of SERP-1. Preservation of articular cartilage was concomitantly noted in treated animals. A dose-response influence on histopathologic change was discernible. CONCLUSION: A viral derived antiinflammatory protein, SERP-1, demonstrates considerable potency in ameliorating chronic inflammation in the AIA model and warrants further investigation as a potential anti-arthritic agent.</ab>

<ab>The genomes of several poxviruses contain open reading frames with homology to the K3 and K5 genes of Kaposi&amp;#39;s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and the K3 gene of murine gammaherpesvirus 68, which target major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) as well as costimulatory molecules for proteasomal or lysosomal degradation. The homologous gene product of myxomavirus (MV), M153R, was recently shown to reduce the cell surface expression of MHC-I. In addition, normal MHC-I surface expression was observed in cells infected with MV lacking M153R (J. L. Guerin, J. Gelfi, S. Boullier, M. Delverdier, F. A. Bellanger, S. Bertagnoli, I. Drexler, G. Sutter, and F. Messud-Petit, J. Virol. 76:2912-2923, 2002). Here, we show that M153R also downregulates the T-cell coreceptor CD4 and we study the molecular mechanism by which M153R achieves the downregulation of CD4 and MHC-I. Upon M153R expression, CD4 was rapidly internalized and degraded in lysosomes, whereas deletion of M153R from the genome of MV restored CD4 expression. The downregulation of both CD4 and MHC-I was dependent on the presence of lysine residues in their cytoplasmic tails. Increased ubiquitination of CD4 was observed upon coexpression with M153R in the presence of inhibitors of lysosomal acidification. Surface expression of CD4 was restored upon overexpression of Hrs, a ubiquitin interaction motif-containing protein that sorts ubiquitinated proteins into endosomes. Moreover, the purified PHD/LAP zinc finger of M153R catalyzed the formation of multiubiquitin adducts in vitro. Our data suggest that M153R acts as a membrane-bound ubiquitin ligase that conjugates ubiquitin to the cytoplasmic domain of substrate glycoproteins, with ubiquitin serving as a lysosomal targeting signal. Since a similar mechanism was recently proposed for KSHV K5, it seems that members of the unrelated families of gamma-2 herpesviruses and poxviruses share a common immune evasion mechanism that targets host cell immune receptors.</ab>

<ab>Shope fibroma virus (SFV), a tumorigenic poxvirus, has a DNA genome of approximately 160 kb. Previous DNA sequence analysis of SFV has been mainly limited to the terminal inverted repetitions (about 12 kb at each end of the genome) and immediately adjacent regions. We have sequenced a 4 kb fragment located approximately 20 kb from the right-terminal hairpin. Within this region three complete and two partial open reading frames (ORFs) have been identified. Each of the putative polypeptides has sequence similarity to one or more previously identified poxvirus or cellular proteins, with homology to protein kinases, erythrocyte ankyrin and a vaccinia virus virulence-related protein (ORF N1L). The potential significance of these gene products with regard to the phenotype of SFV is discussed.</ab>

<ab>Viruses have evolved a number of strategies to gain entry and replicate in host target cells that, for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the poxvirus, myxoma virus, involve appropriating chemokine receptors. In this report we demonstrate that activation of multiple intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation events rapidly ensues following virus adsorption to NIH 3T3.CD4.CCR5 cells and affects the ultimate level of myxoma virus replication. UV-inactivated myxoma virus induces the rapid phosphorylation of CCR5 on tyrosine residues, the association of CCR5 with Jaks and p56(lck), and their phosphorylation-activation within minutes of virus adsorption. Additionally, we provide evidence for myxoma virus-inducible signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS) activation. In contrast to CCR5 activation effected by HIV Env protein, these myxoma virus-inducible phosphorylation events are not sensitive to pertussis toxin treatment. Moreover, in cells that are non-permissive for myxoma virus infection, we provide evidence that myxoma virus fails to invoke this tyrosine phosphorylation cascade. Consistent with the observation that infection of CCR5-expressing cells is blocked by herbimycin A and the Jak 2 inhibitor, tyrophostin AG490, we infer that viral infectivity may be dependent on non-G-protein-coupled signal transduction pathways triggered by the infecting myxoma virus particle. This provides a novel post-binding mechanism by which viruses can co-opt a cellular receptor to permit productive virus infection.</ab>

<ab>Despite the success of the WHO-led smallpox eradication programme a quarter of a century ago, there remains considerable fear that variola virus, or other related pathogenic poxviruses such as monkeypox, could re-emerge and spread disease in the human population. Even today, we are still mostly ignorant about why most poxvirus infections of vertebrate hosts show strict species specificity, or how zoonotic poxvirus infections occur when poxviruses occasionally leap into novel host species. Poxvirus tropism at the cellular level seems to be regulated by intracellular events downstream of virus binding and entry, rather than at the level of specific host receptors as is the case for many other viruses. This review summarizes our current understanding of poxvirus tropism and host range, and discusses the prospects of exploiting host-restricted poxvirus vectors for vaccines, gene therapy or tissue-targeted oncolytic viral therapies for the treatment of human cancers.</ab>

Using Eco RI, Sal I, Bam I, Hpa I and Ava I, the deletions were always observed in the same fragments, while analysis with Hind III demonstrated deletions of identical size in the two terminal fragments. Since vaccinia virus contains inverted terminal repeats of more than 10 kb, these clones possess identical deletions of opposite orientation at both ends of the genome. Analysis of several revertants of the ts mutants demonstrated that the deletions probably arise as events independent from those producing ts lesions and are generated spontaneously at high frequency. This implies that a single event during replication caused the elimination of nonessential information, and suggests that circular intermediates must exist transiently during viral replication.</ab>

<ab>Escherichia coli NY73, possessing a temperature-sensitive mutation in the dnaG locus, was rendered sensitive to bacteriophage phiX174 by P1 transduction. phiX174 reproduces in this strain at 30 C but not at 40 C. All three stages of phiX174 replication, parental replicative form (RF) synthesis, RF replication, and progeny single-stranded DNA synthesis, are thermolabile in this mutant. Competition-annealing data show that both plus- and minus-strand synthesis are equally inhibited after shift up to 40 C during RF replication. We conclude that the dnaG gene product is required for the synthesis of both strands of phiX RF during RF replication and of the complementary strand and viral progeny strands during stages I and III, respectively.</ab>

<ab>Myxoma virus is an infectious poxvirus pathogen that induces a virulent systemic disease called myxomatosis in European rabbits. The disease is rapidly and uniformly fatal to susceptible rabbits and is characterized by generalized dysfunction of cellular immunity and multiple interruptions of the host cytokine network. A number of virus genes are classified as virulence factors because virus constructs bearing targeted gene disruptions induce attenuated disease symptoms. Many of these genes encode proteins that interact directly with effector elements of the host immune system. Included among these immunosubversive viral proteins are secreted mimics of host ligands or regulators (virokines) and homologues of cellular cytokine receptors (viroceptors). Five examples of these immune modulator proteins encoded by myxoma virus are reviewed: (1) myxoma growth factor, a member of the epidermal growth factor ligand superfamily; (2) SERP-1, a secreted serine proteinase inhibitor; (3) M11L, a receptor-like surface protein; (4) T2, a tumor necrosis factor receptor homologue; and (5) T7, an interferon-gamma receptor homologue. The origin of viral strategies designed to subvert immune regulation by host cytokines is considered in the context of the biology of myxoma virus within immunocompetent hosts.</ab>

<ab>Chemokines are low molecular weight cytokines that induce extravasation, chemotaxis, and activation of a wide variety of leukocytes. Members of the different chemokine families are defined by the orientation of specific critical cysteine residues, and are designated as C-X-C (e.g. interleukin-8), C-C (e.g. regulated upon activation normally T cell expressed and secreted, RANTES), or C (lymphotactin). All chemokines bind to members of a G-protein coupled serpentine receptor superfamily that span the leukocyte cell surface membrane seven times and mediate the biological activities of the individual ligands. Most chemokines possess two major binding surfaces: a high affinity site responsible for specific ligand/receptor interactions and a lower affinity site, also called the heparin-binding or glycosaminoglycan-binding domain, believed to be responsible for the establishment and presentation of chemokine gradients on the surface of endothelial cells and within the extracellular matrix. Although chemokines are clearly beneficial in wound healing, hemopoiesis, and the clearance of infectious organisms, the continued expression of chemokines is associated with chronic inflammation. Therefore, this class of cytokines are attractive targets for the creation of antagonists that abrogate one or more chemokine functions. It is envisioned that such antagonists could serve as a new class of anti-inflammatory drugs. In this commentary, we will discuss two different but related strategies for antagonizing chemokine-induced functions, namely, disruption of the low and high affinity binding sites.</ab>

<ab>A number of viruses, particularly members of the poxvirus, herpesvirus and retrovirus families, have adapted to the vertebrate immune responses by capturing and modifying cellular genes which regulate the host immune system. Included among these host-derived virus genes are modified versions of receptors for cytokines or chemokines. Most of these receptor homologs, also called viroceptors, are either secreted glycoproteins or are located at the infected cell surface. Although these viroceptors can act in different ways, collectively they function by modifying the cytokine network to the advantage of the virus rather than the host.</ab>

<ab>The specificity of a given virus for a cell type, tissue or species - collectively known as viral tropism - is an important factor in determining the outcome of viral infection in any particular host. Owing to the increased prevalence of zoonotic infections and the threat of emerging and re-emerging pathogens, gaining a better understanding of the factors that determine viral tropism has become particularly important. In this Review, we summarize our current understanding of the central role of antiviral and pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly the interferons and tumour necrosis factor, in dictating viral tropism and how these cytokine pathways can be exploited therapeutically for cancer treatment and to better counter future threats from emerging zoonotic pathogens.</ab>

<ab>In the past year, important advances have been made in the area of host-related immunomodulatory genes encoded by the larger DNA viruses, particularly for the poxviruses and herpesviruses. Not only has the repertoire of viral immunomodulator homologs expanded as a result of sequencing the complete genome of another six, large DNA viruses, but also new concepts of how they work have been proposed and in some cases supported by in vivo evidence. Recent developments have been made in understanding a spectrum of host-related viral modulators, including complement control proteins, TNF-receptor homologs, IL-18 binding proteins, viral interleukins (vIL-6 and vIL-10), chemokine mimics and chemokine receptor homologs.</ab>

<ab>Many poxviruses encode a plethora of immunomodulatory proteins, including homologs of cellular cytokine receptors. These receptor mimics, also referred to as viroceptors, are believed to function by binding and sequestering host cytokines thus preventing their signaling cascade prior to receptor engagement. The M-T2 protein of myxoma virus is a TNF receptor homolog that has two distinct activities: the secreted dimeric M-T2 protein binds and inhibits TNF alpha while the intracellular version permits myxoma virus replication in infected T-lymphocytes by blocking the cellular apoptosis response to the virus infection. Studies with M-T2 mutants reveal that distinct protein domains mediate these two anti-immune properties of this protein.</ab>

<ab>BACKGROUND: Transplant vasculopathy remains a difficult therapeutic problem, resulting in the majority of late cardiac graft losses. This chronic vascular disease is thought to be triggered by alloantigen-dependent and alloantigen-independent inflammatory factors. Despite improved 1-year survival, the incidence of transplant vasculopathy has not improved with current immunosuppressive protocols. Highly effective strategies have evolved in the large DNA viruses that shield infecting viruses from host inflammatory responses. Serp-1 is a secreted myxoma virus anti-inflammatory serine proteinase inhibitor. Serp-1 inhibits plasminogen activators in a manner similar to plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), a vascular protein that plays a pivotal regulatory role in vascular wound healing. In this study, we tested the ability of purified Serp-1 protein to ameliorate posttransplant vasculopathy after rat aortic allograft surgery. METHODS AND RESULTS: Serp-1 protein or controls were infused into 98 rats immediately after segmental aortic allograft transplantation. After either late (28 days, 64 rats) or early (12 to 48 hours, 24 rats) follow-up, transplanted aortic segments were harvested for morphological and immunohistochemical analysis. Significant reductions in intimal plaque growth (P&amp;lt;0.002) and mononuclear cell invasion (P&amp;lt;0.033) were detected after Serp-1 infusion at nanogram doses. Serp-1 reduced early macrophage (P&amp;lt;0.0016) and nonspecific lymphocyte (P&amp;lt;0.0179) invasion into medial and adventitial layers and inhibited associated depletion of medial smooth muscle cells (P&amp;lt;0.0006). CONCLUSIONS: Infusion of a viral anti-inflammatory serpin, Serp-1, significantly reduces early inflammatory responses and later luminal occlusion in a rat aortic allograft model.</ab>

<ab>The orchestration of the inflammatory responses to both infection and tissue damage is arguably the key physiological function of NF-kappaB, and thus interference with the activation of NF-kappaB represents an exceptional strategy for a successful pathogen to exploit to counter multiple host innate defense processes through the targeting of a single host regulatory pathway. Because of their large genomes, which typically encode approximately 200 proteins, and their unusual independence from the host nuclear transcriptional machinery, poxviruses are especially well suited to manipulate the cytoplasmic activation of NF-kappaB. Indeed, poxviruses are known to encode multiple proteins that regulate the activation of NF-kappaB in a variety of different ways and these can be considered potential paradigms for the development of novel anti-inflammatory therapies and more effective vaccines. Given the renewed interest in the pathogenesis of orthopoxviruses like smallpox and monkeypox, we review the current understanding of how the various classes of poxviral immunomodulatory proteins target and manipulate the NF-kappaB pathway.</ab>

<ab>Identification of the binary interactions between viral and host proteins has become a valuable tool for investigating viral tropism and pathogenesis. Here, we present the first systematic protein interaction screening of the unique variola virus proteome by using yeast 2-hybrid screening against a variety of human cDNA libraries. Several protein-protein interactions were identified, including an interaction between variola G1R, an ankryin/F-box containing protein, and human nuclear factor kappa-B1 (NF-kappaB1)/p105. This represents the first direct interaction between a pathogen-encoded protein and NF-kappaB1/p105. Orthologs of G1R are present in a variety of pathogenic orthopoxviruses, but not in vaccinia virus, and expression of any one of these viral proteins blocks NF-kappaB signaling in human cells. Thus, proteomic screening of variola virus has the potential to uncover modulators of the human innate antiviral responses.</ab>

<ab>Many pathogenic orthopoxviruses like variola virus, monkeypox virus, and cowpox virus (CPXV), but not vaccinia virus, encode a unique family of ankyrin (ANK) repeat-containing proteins that interact directly with NF-kappaB1/p105 and inhibit the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Here, we present the in vitro and in vivo characterization of the targeted gene knockout of this novel NF-kappaB inhibitor in CPXV. Our results demonstrate that the vCpx-006KO uniquely induces a variety of NF-kappaB-controlled proinflammatory cytokines from infected myeloid cells, accompanied by a rapid phosphorylation of the IkappaB kinase complex and subsequent degradation of the NF-kappaB cellular inhibitors IkappaBalpha and NF-kappaB1/p105. Moreover, the vCpx-006KO virus was attenuated for virulence in mice and induced a significantly elevated cellular inflammatory process at tissue sites of virus replication in the lung. These results indicate that members of this ANK repeat family are utilized specifically by pathogenic orthopoxviruses to repress the NF-kappaB signaling pathway at tissue sites of virus replication in situ.</ab>

<ab>Myxoma virus is a pathogenic poxvirus that induces a lethal myxomatosis disease profile in European rabbits, which is characterized by fulminating lesions at the primary site of inoculation, rapid dissemination to secondary internal organs and peripheral external sites, and supervening gram-negative bacterial infection. Here we describe the role of a novel myxoma virus protein encoded by the M-T5 open reading frame during pathogenesis. The myxoma virus M-T5 protein possesses no significant sequence homology to nonviral proteins but is a member of a larger poxviral superfamily designated host range proteins. An M-T5- mutant virus was constructed by disruption of both copies of the M-T5 gene followed by insertion of the selectable marker p7.5Ecogpt. Although the M-T5- deletion mutant replicated with wild-type kinetics in rabbit fibroblasts, infection of a rabbit CD4+ T-cell line (RL5) with the myxoma virus M-T5- mutant virus resulted in the rapid and complete cessation of both host and viral protein synthesis, accompanied by the manifestation of all the classical features of programmed cell death. Infection of primary rabbit peripheral mononuclear cells with the myxoma virus M-T5-mutant virus resulted in the apoptotic death of nonadherent lymphocytes but not adherent monocytes. Within the European rabbit, disruption of the M-T5 open reading frame caused a dramatic attenuation of the rapidly lethal myxomatosis infection, and none of the infected rabbits displayed any of the characteristic features of myxomatosis. The two most significant histological observations in rabbits infected with the M-T5-mutant virus were (i) the lack of progression of the infection past the primary site of inoculation, coupled with the establishment of a rapid and effective inflammatory reaction, and (ii) the inability of the virus to initiate a cellular reaction within secondary immune organs. We conclude that M-T5 functions as a critical virulence factor by allowing productive infection of immune cells such as peripheral lymphocytes, thus facilitating virus dissemination to secondary tissue sites via the lymphatic channels.</ab>

<ab>Myxoma virus is a leporipoxvirus of New World rabbits (Sylvilagus sp.) that induces a rapidly lethal infection known as myxomatosis in the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Like all poxviruses, myxoma virus encodes a plethora of proteins to circumvent or inhibit a variety of host antiviral immune mechanisms. M-T7, the most abundantly secreted protein of myxoma virus-infected cells, was originally identified as an interferon-gamma receptor homolog (Upton, Mossman, and McFadden, Science 258, 1369-1372, 1992). Here, we demonstrate that M-T7 is dispensable for virus replication in cultured cells but is a critical virulence factor for virus pathogenesis in European rabbits. Disruption of both copies of the M-T7 gene in myxoma virus was achieved by the deletion of 372 bp of M-T7 coding sequences, replacement with a selectable marker, p7.5Ecogpt, and selection of a recombinant virus (vMyxlac-T7gpt) resistant to mycophenolic acid. vMyxlac-T7gpt expressed no detectable M-T7 protein and infected cells supernatants were devoid of any detectable interferon-gamma binding activities. Immunohistochemical staining with anti-beta-galactosidase and anti-CD43 antibodies demonstrated that in vMyxlac-T7gpt-infected rabbits the loss of M-T7 not only caused a dramatic reduction in disease symptoms and viral dissemination to secondary sites, but also dramatically influenced host leukocyte behavior. Notably, primary lesions in wild-type virus infections were generally underlayed by large masses of inflammatory cells that did not effectively migrate into the dermal sites of viral replication, whereas in vMyxlac-T7gpt infections this apparent block to leukocyte influx was relieved. A second major phenotypic distinction noted for the M-T7 knockout virus was the extensive activation of lymphocytes in secondary immune organs, particularly the spleen and lymph nodes, by Day 4 of the infection. This is in stark contrast to infection by wild-type myxoma virus, which results in relatively little, if any, cellular activation of germinal centers of spleen and lymph node by Day 4. We conclude that M-T7 functions early in infection to (1) retard inflammatory cell migration into infected tissues and (2) disrupt the communication between sentinel immune cells at the site of primary virus infection in the subdermis and lymphocytes in the secondary lymphoid organs, thereby disabling the host from mounting an effective cellular immune response. To summarize, in addition to neutralizing host interferon-gamma at infected sites, we propose that M-T7 protein also modifies leukocyte traffic in the vicinity of virus lesions, thus effectively severing the link between antigen presenting cells of the infected tissue and the effector lymphocytes of the peripheral immune organs.</ab>

<ab>Sequence analysis of the genomes of the Leporipoxviruses myxoma virus and Shope fibroma virus (SFV) led to the discovery of open reading frames homologous to the vaccinia H1L gene encoding a soluble protein phosphatase with dual tyrosine/serine specificity. These viral phosphatase genes were subsequently localized to the myxoma BamHI-I fragment and the SFV BamHI-M fragment, and the resulting encoded proteins were designated I1L and M1L, respectively. The localization and orientation of the myxoma I1L and SFV M1L open reading frames within the well conserved central core of the viral genomes closely mirror that of the Orthopoxviruses vaccinia virus and variola virus. The myxoma I1L and SFV M1L phosphatases each contain the conserved tyrosine phosphatase signature sequence motif, (I/V)HCXAGXXR(S/T)G, including the active site cysteine, found previously to be essential for phosphotyrosine dephosphorylation. The vaccinia H1L phosphatase was originally shown to have the ability to dephosphorylate phosphotyrosyl and phosphoseryl residues in vitro. To assess whether this is a common feature of poxvirus phosphatases, myxoma I1L was expressed as a GST-fusion protein, purified, and shown to dephosphorylate substrates containing tyrosine and serine phosphorylated residues, in a similar fashion to vaccinia H1L. A myxoma I1L variant, in which the active site cysteine 110 was mutated to serine, was expressed in a parallel fashion to the wild-type I1L protein and found to be completely deficient in its ability to dephosphorylate both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine amino acids. In an attempt to ascertain the biological requirement for the myxoma I1L phosphatase, we constructed a recombinant myxoma virus containing a disrupted I1L open reading frame. This I1L mutant virus was able to successfully propagate in tissue culture only in the presence of a wild-type complementing gene, and pure virus clones containing only the disrupted allele were not viable. Thus, we conclude that the myxoma I1L dual specificity phosphatase is an essential factor for virus viability.</ab>

<ab>The myxoma virus M-T7 protein contains significant sequence similarity to the ligand binding domain of the mammalian interferon-gamma receptors, and functions as a soluble homolog which can bind and inhibit the biological activities of rabbit interferon-gamma (Upton, C., Mossman, K., and McFadden, G. (1992) Science 258:1369-1372). M-T7, the most abundantly secreted protein from myxoma virus-infected cells, was shown to be expressed in significant biological amounts as a typical poxvirus early gene product, efficiently secreted at early times of infection to levels that exceed 5 x 10(7) molecules/cell, and function as a stable inhibitory protein in infected cell supernatants until late times of infection. M-T7 was specific in binding and inhibiting rabbit interferon-gamma, and did not bind either human or murine interferon-gamma. Scatchard analysis of rabbit interferon-gamma binding curves yielded a single high affinity binding site on M-T7, with a Kd of 1.2 x 10(-9) M, which is comparable to the affinity between soluble forms of cellular interferon-gamma receptors and their cognate ligands. In comparison, rabbit interferon-gamma was shown to bind its cellular receptor with a Kd of 5.9 x 10(-10) M, again comparable to the affinity of membrane bound forms of other mammalian interferon-gamma receptors for interferon-gamma. Thus, the myxoma virus M-T7 protein is a functional soluble interferon-gamma receptor homolog which binds and inhibits interferon-gamma with high affinity in a species-specific manner.</ab>

<ab>The presence of zoonotic poxviruses in nature represents a potential human health risk that has to be re-evaluated by health authorities not only in developing countries, but also in many developed countries. For example, buffalopox virus infection remains to be a threat to humans and cattle in India, and monkeypox virus infection persists in several inhabited places in Africa and, more recently, in the USA. There are also a great number of zoonotic transmissions of cowpox virus from cats to humans in Europe. For almost a decade in Brazil, vaccinia-like viruses have been isolated from human and cattle infections. This review examines the ability of potentially pathogenic orthopoxviruses, including feral versions of vaccinia virus vaccine, to persist in nature and re-emerge for reasons we do not yet understand.</ab>

<ab>Myxoma virus is a poxvirus pathogen of rabbits that has evolved to replicate successfully in the presence of an active immune response by an infected host. To accomplish this, the virus has developed a variety of strategies to avoid detection by or obstruct specific aspects of the antiviral response whose consolidated action is antagonistic to virus survival. We describe two distinct viral strategies carried out by viral proteins with which myxoma virus subverts the host immune response. The first strategy is the production of virus-encoded proteins known as viroceptors or virokines that mimic host receptors or cytokines. These seek to actively block extracellular immune signals required for effective virus clearance and produce a local environment in the infected tissue that is &amp;quot;virus friendly&amp;quot;. The second strategy, carried out by intracellular viral proteins, seeks to retard the innate antiviral responses such as apoptosis, and hinder attempts by the infected cell to communicate with the cellular arm of the immune system. By studying these viral strategies of immune evasion, the myxoma system can provide insights into virus-host interactions and also provide new insights into the complex immune system.</ab>

<ab>SERP-1 is a secreted serpin (serine-proteinase inhibitor) encoded by myxoma virus, a poxvirus pathogen of rabbits. SERP-1 is required for myxoma-virus virulence, and the purified protein has been shown to possess independent anti-inflammatory activity in animal models of restenosis and antigen-induced arthritis. As an inhibitor of serine proteinases, SERP-1 acts against tissue-type plasminogen activator, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, plasmin, thrombin and Factor Xa. In the present study, examination of SERP-1 glycosylation-site mutants showed that the N-linked glycosylation of Asn(172) was essential for SERP-1 secretion, whereas mutation of Asn(99) decreased secretion efficiency, indicating that N-linked glycosylation plays an essential role in the processing and trafficking of SERP-1. Furthermore, comparison of SERP-1 from wild-type myxoma virus and a virus containing a targeted disruption of the MST3N sialyltransferase locus demonstrated that SERP-1 is specifically modified by this myxoma-virus-encoded sialyltransferase, and is thus the first reported viral protein shown to by modified by a virally encoded glycosyltransferase. Sialylation of SERP-1 by the MST3N gene product creates a uniquely charged species of secreted SERP-1 that is distinct from SERP-1 produced from other eukaryotic expression systems, though this has no apparent effect upon the kinetics of in vitro proteinase inhibition. Rather, the role of viral sialylation of SERP-1 likely relates to masking antigenicity or targeting SERP-1 to specific sites of action in vivo.</ab>

<ab>Linear free energy relationships can be used to link the changes in rate constant for a reaction to changes in the equilibrium caused by alterations in structure. While they have most often been used in the analysis of chemical reactions, they have also been employed to resolve questions in enzymology and protein folding. Here we analyze the reaction of a serpin with a panel of six serine proteinases, and observe that a linear free energy relationship exists between the true second-order rate constant for reaction, k(inh), and the inhibition constant, K(I), indicating that formation of the covalent serpin-enzyme complex may be reversible.</ab>

<ab>SERP-1 is a myxoma virus-encoded serpin, secreted from infected cells, that is required for virulence and has anti-inflammatory activity. We report that purified recombinant SERP-1 forms SDS-stable complexes with urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), plasmin, thrombin, and factor Xa. N-terminal sequencing confirmed Arg319-Asn320 as the site of reaction. Mutation of these residues to Ala-Ala abolished inhibitory activity but had no effect on the specific cleavage at Thr315-Leu316 seen with elastase and with cathepsin G. Kinetic analysis of the reactions with uPA, tPA, plasmin, thrombin, Xa, and C1s showed second-order rate constants to vary over 3 logs, from kinh = 3 x 10(5) M-1 s-1 with thrombin to approximately 600 M-1 s-1 with C1s, while steady-state inhibition constants ranged from KI = 10 pM with thrombin to approximately 100 nM with C1s. Stoichiometries of inhibition varied between SI = 1.4 +/- 0.1 for uPA to SI = 13 +/- 3 for thrombin. Analysis of the variations in inhibition kinetics shows that when serpins act at low concentrations, comparable with the target protease or with KI (as appears likely for SERP-1 in vivo), inhibitory specificity becomes less dominated by kinh and is increasingly dependent on partitioning within the branched reaction mechanism and on the lifetime of the inhibited complex.</ab>

<ab>Members of the genus Yatapoxvirus, which include Tanapox virus (TPV) and Yaba monkey tumor virus, infect primates including humans. Two strains of TPV isolated 50 years apart from patients infected from the equatorial region of Africa have been sequenced. The original isolate from a human case in the Tana River Valley, Kenya, in 1957 (TPV-Kenya) and an isolate from an infected traveler in the Republic of Congo in 2004 (TPV-RoC). Although isolated 50 years apart the genomes were highly conserved. The genomes differed at only 35 of 144,565 nucleotide positions (99.98% identical). We predict that TPV-RoC encodes 155 ORFs, however a single transversion (at nucleotide 10241) in TPV-Kenya resulted in the coding capacity for two predicted ORFs (11.1L and 11.2L) in comparison to a single ORF (11L) in TPV-RoC. The genomes of TPV are A+T rich (73%) and 96% of the sequence encodes predicted ORFs. Comparative genomic analysis identified several features shared with other chordopoxviruses. A conserved sequence within the terminal inverted repeat region that is also present in the other members of the Yatapoxviruses as well as members of the Capripoxviruses, Swinepox virus and an unclassified Deerpox virus suggests the existence of a conserved near-terminal sequence secondary structure. Two previously unidentified gene families were annotated that are represented by ORF TPV28L, which matched homologues in certain other chordopoxviruses, and TPV42.5L, which is highly conserved among currently reported chordopoxvirus sequences.</ab>

<ab>Tanapox virus (TPV) belongs to the genus Yatapoxvirus and causes a relatively benign zoonotic disease in man, with symptoms that resemble a mild version of human monkeypox. In order to investigate the underlying mechanisms of TPV pathogenesis, the tropism and replication characteristics of TPV were examined in a variety of primary human cells. A GFP expressing TPV (TPV-GFP) was constructed and used to infect primary human dermal fibroblasts (pHDFs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), both of which are believed to be major in vivo targets of poxvirus infection. pHDFs fully supported productive replication and cell-cell spread of TPV-GFP. However, induction of cell cycle arrest in pHDFs by contact mediated inhibition or rapamycin treatment eliminated the ability of TPV to fully stimulate cell cycle progression and dramatically reduced viral replication. TPV-GFP-infected human PBMCs were screened for permissiveness by FACS analysis. CD14+ cells (monocytes) were the primary cellular target for TPV infection. A small proportion of CD3+ cells (T cells) were positive for GFP expression, yet TPV was not able to replicate and spread in cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes, regardless of their state of activation. Primary human monocytes, however, demonstrated robust TPV replication, yet these cells no longer supported replication of TPV once they differentiated into macrophages. This unique ex vivo tropism of TPV gives key insights into the basis for the self-limiting pathogenicity of TPV in man.</ab>

<ab>Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a critical proinflammatory cytokine whose extracellular bioactivity is regulated by a cellular IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP). Many poxviruses have acquired variants of this IL-18BP gene, some of which have been shown to act as viral virulence factors. Yaba monkey tumor virus (YMTV) encodes a related family member, 14L, which is similar to the orthopoxvirus IL-18BPs. YMTV 14L was expressed from a baculovirus system and tested for its ability to bind and inhibit IL-18. We found that YMTV 14L bound both human IL-18 (hIL-18) and murine IL-18 with high affinity, at 4.1 nM and 6.5 nM, respectively. YMTV 14L was able to fully sequester hIL-18 but could only partially inhibit the biological activity of hIL-18 as measured by gamma interferon secretion from KG-1 cells. Additionally, 17 hIL-18 point mutants were tested by surface plasmon resonance for their ability to bind to YMTV 14L. Two clusters of hIL-18 surface residues were found to be important for the hIL-18-YMTV 14L interaction, in contrast to results for the Variola virus IL-18BP, which has been shown to primarily interact with a single cluster of three amino acids. The altered binding specificity of YMTV 14L most likely represents an adaptation resulting in increased fitness of the virus and affirms the plasticity of poxviral inhibitor domains that target cytokines like IL-18.</ab>

<ab>PURPOSE: The purpose of these studies was to investigate the role of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in the regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) activity in rabbit corneal cells. METHODS: Rabbit corneal epithelial, stromal, and endothelial cells were grown in culture and treated with cytokines and growth factors, alone or in combination. NOS activity was measured at times up to 72 hours after treatment by assaying the culture medium for nitrite using the Griess reaction. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot analysis for NOS2 protein. RNA was isolated and amplified with NOS1-, NOS2-, and NOS3-specific primers by RT-PCR. RESULTS: NOS2 expression was induced by combined cytokine treatment from nondetectable levels to abundant levels in low passage (10 microM) until after 24 hours postinduction. NOS2 was identified as a 130 kDa protein on Western blot analysis using monoclonal antibody against murine NOS2. TGF-beta(1) and beta(2) inhibited the accumulation of cytokine-induced nitrite in a dose-dependent manner while not significantly reducing the steady state level of NOS2 mRNA. The activity of the induced NOS was inhibited by 1400W, a NOS2-selective inhibitor, but not 7-nitroindazole, a NOS1-selective inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: In cultured corneal stromal cells, NOS2 expression was upregulated by IFN-gamma in combination with IL-1beta and TNF-alpha but not by any of these cytokines alone, while TGF-beta downregulated the activity. Cultures of corneal epithelial cells could not be induced to express NOS2, yet cultures of endothelial cells produced low amounts of NO in response to cytokines. The NOS1 and NOS3 isoforms were not detected in any of these corneal cells.</ab>

<ab>Myxoma virus (MYX) is a leporipoxvirus of rabbits that induces a lethal syndrome characterized by disseminated tumorlike lesions, generalized immunosuppression, and secondary gram-negative bacterial infection. A MYX deletion mutant (vMYX-GF- delta M11L) was constructed to remove the entire myxoma growth factor (MGF) coding sequence and that for the C-terminal five amino acids of the partially overlapping upstream gene, M11L. Unexpectedly, this deletion completely abrogates the capacity of MYX to cause the characteristic disease symptoms of myxomatosis. Upon inoculation of rabbits with vMYX-GF- delta M11L, recipient animals developed only a benign, localized nodule reminiscent of a Shope fibroma virus-induced tumor in which a single primary lesion appeared at the site of injection and then completely regressed within 14 days, leaving the animals resistant to challenge with wild-type MYX. No evidence of the purulent conjunctivitis and rhinitis that always accompany wild-type MYX infection was observed. To ascertain whether the attenuation observed in vMYX-GF- delta M11L was due to a combined effect of the MGF deletion and alteration of the upstream M11L gene, two additional MYX recombinants were constructed: an MGF- virus (vMYX-GF-) containing an intact M11L gene and an M11L- virus (vMYX-M11L-) containing an intact MGF gene. Infection with vMYX-GF- resulted in moderated symptoms of myxomatosis, but all clinical stages of the disease were still detectable. In contrast, disruption of M11L alone dramatically reduced the virus virulence, resulting in a nonlethal syndrome whose clinical course was nevertheless distinct from that of vMYX-GF- delta M11L. Upon inoculation with vMYX-M11L-, rabbits developed primary and secondary tumors which were larger and more circumscribed than those of wild-type MYX recipients. Whereas wild-type MYX infection always includes severe, purulent conjunctivitis and rhinitis, vMYX-M11L- recipients remained healthy and displayed only minimal signs of respiratory distress. By about 30 days after infection, the tumors induced by vMYX-M11L- had completely regressed and these animals were immune to challenge with wild-type MYX. Histological analysis indicated that tumors induced by vMYX-M11L- are much more heavily infiltrated with macrophages and heterophils and that the sites of viral replication are more edematous and necrotic than those of wild-type infection, suggesting that the host was able to mount a more vigorous inflammatory response to vMYX-M11L- infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</ab>

<ab>The epidermal growth factor (EGF) homologues encoded by vaccinia virus, myxoma virus, and malignant rabbit fibroma virus have been shown to contribute to the pathogenicity of virus infection upon inoculation of susceptible hosts. However, since the primary structures of these growth factors and the disease profiles induced by different poxvirus genera vary substantially, the degree to which the various EGF homologues perform similar roles in viral pathogenesis remains unclear. In order to determine whether different EGF-like growth factors can perform qualitatively similar functions in the induction of myxomatosis in rabbits, we created recombinant myxoma virus variants in which the native growth factor, myxoma growth factor (MGF), was disrupted and replaced with either vaccinia virus growth factor, Shope fibroma growth factor, or rat transforming growth factor alpha. Unlike the control virus containing an inactivated MGF gene, which caused marked attenuation of the disease syndrome and substantially less proliferation of the epithelial cell layers in the conjunctiva and respiratory tract, the recombinant myxoma virus strains expressing heterologous growth factors produced infections which were both clinically and histopathologically indistinguishable from wild-type myxomatosis. We conclude that these poxviral and cellular EGF-like growth factors, which are diverse with respect to primary structure and origin, have similar biological functions in the context of myxoma virus pathogenesis and are mitogenic for the same target cells.</ab>

<ab>The role of the epidermal growth factor homologue in malignant rabbit fibroma virus (MRV) pathogenicity was investigated by constructing a viral growth factor deletion mutant (MRV-GF-). Since MRV is a recombinant virus with a myxoma virus background but possesses some terminal sequences derived from Shope fibroma virus, the growth factor gene in MRV is in fact identical to Shope fibroma growth factor (SFGF). Although no significant differences were detected in the in vitro characteristics of MRV and MRV-GF-, a pronounced attenuation was observed after inoculation of the test rabbits with MRV-GF-. Animals infected with wild-type MRV uniformly developed a fatal syndrome involving disseminated tumors accompanied by purulent conjunctivitis and rhinitis. In contrast, although MRV-GF- recipients developed similar initial signs of the MRV disease syndrome, 75% of these animals completely recovered from the viral and secondary bacterial infections and became immune to subsequent MRV challenge. Tumors in MRV-GF- recipients displayed earlier and more prominent inflammatory reactions than their wild-type MRV counterparts and contained fewer proliferating cells. Squamous metaplasia and hyperplasia of target epithelia were less pronounced in MRV-GF- than in MRV infection. We conclude that SFGF is a major virulence factor in MRV infection and is responsible for at least some of the cellular proliferation observed at tumor sites. In addition, the diminished ability of MRV-GF- to cause hyperplasia in nasal and conjunctival epithelia may decrease the extent of gram negative bacterial overgrowth as compared to the parental virus and hence contribute to the dramatic reduction in the lethality of MRV-GF- infection.</ab>

<ab>The Yatapoxviruses encode a distinct class of secreted TNF-binding protein (TNF-BP) that resembles an MHC class I heavy chain but distinct from any other known TNF inhibitor. Characterization of these viral TNF inhibitors from Tanapox virus, Yaba monkey tumor virus (YMTV) and a closely related version from Swinepox virus revealed dramatically differential TNF binding specificities for different mammalian species. The Tanapox virus 2L protein (TPV-2L) formed inhibitory complexes with human TNF, and interacted with monkey and canine TNF with high affinity but rabbit TNF with low affinity. On the other hand, YMTV-2L bound human and monkey TNF with high affinity but rabbit TNF with only low affinity. The TNF-BP from swinepox virus (SPV003/148) only interacted with porcine TNF with high affinity. The observed TNF binding analysis mirrored the biological activity of these TNF-binding protein to block TNF-induced cellular cytolysis. TPV-2L and YMTV-2L also inhibited the human TNF-mediated signaling in cells but TPV-2L exhibited higher affinity for human TNF (KD, 43 pm) compared with monkey (KD, 120 pm) whereas for YMTV-2L, the affinities were reversed (human TNF KD, 440 pm; monkey TNF KD, 230 pm). The interaction domain of human TNF with TNF-binding proteins is significantly different from that of TNFRs, as determined using human TNF mutants. We conclude that these poxvirus TNF-binding proteins represent a new class of TNF inhibitors and are distinct from the viral TNF receptor homologues characterized to date.</ab>

<ab>Tanapox virus (TPV) encodes and expresses a secreted TNF-binding protein, TPV-2L or gp38, that displays inhibitory properties against TNF from diverse mammalian species, including human, monkey, canine and rabbit. TPV-2L also has sequence similarity with the MHC-class I heavy chain and interacts differently with human TNF as compared to the known cellular TNF receptors or any of the known virus-encoded TNF receptor homologs derived from many poxviruses. In order to determine the TNF binding region in TPV-2L, various TPV-2L C-terminal truncations and internal deletions were created and the muteins were expressed using recombinant baculovirus vectors. C-terminal deletions from TPV-2L resulted in reduced binding affinity for human TNF and specific mutants of TNF that discriminate between TNF-R1 and TNF-R2. However, deletion of C-terminal 42 amino acid residues totally abolished the binding of human TNF and its mutants. Removal of any of the predicted internal domains resulted in a mutant TPV-2L protein incapable of binding to human TNF. Deletion of C-terminal residues also affected the ability of TPV-2L to block TNF-induced cellular cytotoxicity. In addition to TNF, TPV-2L can also form complexes with human beta2-microglobulin to form a novel macromolecular complex. In summary, the TPV-2L protein is a bona fide MHC-1 heavy chain family member that binds and inhibits human TNF in a fashion very distinct from other known poxvirus-encoded TNF inhibitors, and also can form a novel complex with the human MHC-1 light chain, beta2-microglobulin.</ab>

<ab>The immune system functions by maintaining a delicate balance between the activities of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways. Unbalanced activation of these pathways often leads to the development of serious inflammatory diseases. TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor) is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine, which can cause several inflammatory diseases when inappropriately up-regulated. Inhibition of TNF activities by using modulatory recombinant proteins has become a successful therapeutic approach to control TNF activity levels but these anti-TNF reagents also have risks and certain limitations. Biological molecules with a different mode of action in regulating TNF biology might provide a clinically useful alternative to the current therapeutics or in some cases might be efficacious in combination with existinganti-TNF therapies. TNF is also a powerful host defense cytokine commonly induced in the host response against various invading pathogens. Many viral pathogens can block TNF function by encoding modulators of TNF, its receptors or downstream signaling pathways. Here, we review the known virus-encoded TNF inhibitors and evaluate their potential as alternative future anti-TNF therapies.</ab>

<ab>High-dose chemotherapy and radiation followed by autologous blood and marrow transplantation (ABMT) has been used for the treatment of certain cancers that are refractory to standard therapeutic regimes. However, a major challenge with ABMT for patients with hematologic malignancies is disease relapse, mainly due to either contamination with cancerous hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) within the autograft or the persistence of residual therapy-resistant disease niches within the patient. Oncolytic viruses represent a promising therapeutic approach to prevent cancer relapse by eliminating tumor-initiating cells that contaminate the autograft. Here we summarize an ex vivo &amp;quot;purging&amp;quot; strategy with oncolytic Myxoma virus (MYXV) to remove cancer-initiating cells from patient autografts prior to transplantation. MYXV, a novel oncolytic poxvirus with potent anti-cancer properties in a variety of in vivo tumor models, can specifically eliminate cancerous stem and progenitor cells from samples obtained from acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients, while sparing normal CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells capable of rescuing hematopoiesis following high dose conditioning. We propose that a broader subset of patients with intractable hematologic malignancies who have failed standard therapy could become eligible for ABMT when the treatment schema is coupled with ex vivo oncolytic therapy.</ab>

<ab>In response to invasion by microbial pathogens, host defense mechanisms get activated by both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune responses. TNF (tumor necrosis factor) is a potent proinflammatory cytokine expressed by activated macrophages and lymphocytes that induces diverse cellular responses that can vary from apoptosis to the expression of genes involved in both early inflammatory and acquired immune responses. A wide spectrum of microbes has acquired elegant mechanisms to overcome or deflect the host responses mediated by TNF. For example, modulatory proteins encoded by multiple families of viruses can block TNF and TNF-mediated responses at multiple levels, such as the inhibition of the TNF ligand or its receptors, or by modulating key transduction molecules of the TNF signaling pathway. Bacteria, on the other hand, tend to modify TNF-mediated responses specifically by regulating components of the TNF signaling pathway. Investigation of these diverse strategies employed by viral and bacterial pathogens has significantly advanced our understanding of both host TNF responses and microbial pathogenesis. This review summarizes the diverse microbial strategies to regulate TNF and how such insights into TNF modulation could benefit the treatment of inflammatory or autoimmune diseases.</ab>

<ab>NF-kappaB and inflammasomes both play central roles in orchestrating anti-pathogen responses by rapidly inducing a variety of early-response cytokines and chemokines following infection. Myxoma virus (MYXV), a pathogenic poxvirus of rabbits, encodes a member of the cellular pyrin domain (PYD) superfamily, called M013. The viral M013 protein was previously shown to bind host ASC-1 protein and inhibit the cellular inflammasome complex that regulates the activation and secretion of caspase 1-regulated cytokines such as IL-1beta and IL-18. Here, we report that human THP-1 monocytic cells infected with a MYXV construct deleted for the M013L gene (vMyxM013-KO), in stark contrast to the parental MYXV, rapidly induce high levels of secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF, IL-6, and MCP-1, all of which are regulated by NF-kappaB. The induction of these NF-kappaB regulated cytokines following infection with vMyxM013-KO was also confirmed in vivo using THP-1 derived xenografts in NOD-SCID mice. vMyxM013-KO virus infection specifically induced the rapid phosphorylation of IKK and degradation of IkappaBalpha, which was followed by nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB/p65. Even in the absence of virus infection, transiently expressed M013 protein alone inhibited cellular NF-kappaB-mediated reporter gene expression and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB/p65. Using protein/protein interaction analysis, we show that M013 protein also binds directly with cellular NF-kappaB1, suggesting a direct physical and functional linkage between NF-kappaB1 and ASC-1. We further demonstrate that inhibition of the inflammasome with a caspase-1 inhibitor did not prevent the induction of NF-kappaB regulated cytokines following infection with vMyxM013-KO virus, but did block the activation of IL-1beta. Thus, the poxviral M013 inhibitor exerts a dual immuno-subversive role in the simultaneous co-regulation of both the cellular inflammasome complex and NF-kappaB-mediated pro-inflammatory responses.</ab>

<ab>The myxoma virus-encoded M-T2 protein shares extensive sequence homology with the ligand-binding domains of the TNF receptors (TNFRs) and has been shown to bind and inhibit rabbit TNF-alpha with affinities similar to those of TNF-alpha with cellular receptors. Here we show that M-T2 protein is secreted from infected cells as an N-linked glycoprotein, with both complex and hybrid or high mannose oligosaccharide chains. Since amino acid homology between M-T2 and cellular TNF receptors is limited to the four N-terminal cysteine-rich domains (CRDs), various M-T2 C-terminal truncations were created in recombinant vaccinia virus vectors. C-terminal deletions that include truncations up to the middle of the fourth CRD effectively bound and inhibited rabbit TNF-alpha. In contrast, removal of any one of the first three CRDs resulted in a mutant M-T2 protein incapable of binding or inhibiting rabbit TNF-alpha. The C-terminal portion of M-T2, which is not homologous to the cellular TNFRs, appears to be important for efficient secretion of M-T2 from infected cells, since all the C-terminal truncations, including a truncation removing only the last 24 amino acids, were effectively retained as intracellular proteins that were still capable of binding and inhibiting rabbit TNF-alpha. We conclude that the first three CRDs of M-T2 fulfill the same ligand-binding function as the cellular TNFRs, and the nonhomologous C-terminal region participates in protein trafficking of M-T2 in virus-infected cells.</ab>

<ab>The myxoma virus T2 protein shares extensive homology with the ligand binding domains of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors. To characterize the T2-TNF interaction, myxoma T2 protein and rabbit, mouse, and human TNF alpha were expressed independently from vaccinia virus vectors. Growth of the TNF alpha-expressing viruses was significantly attenuated in TNF-hypersensitive L929-8 cells, and these cells were rapidly lysed by all three TNF alpha s. Rabbit cells showed strict species specificity in that RK-13 and SIRC cells were only sensitive to lysis by the homologous rabbit TNF alpha. Although RK-13 cells were hypersensitive to rabbit TNF alpha even in the absence of protein synthesis inhibitors, growth of T2 nonexpressing myxoma and vaccinia viruses in RK-13 cells was only modestly reduced in the presence of rabbit TNF alpha, suggesting that poxviruses possess additional anti-TNF mechanisms. When the ability of the myxoma T2 protein to inhibit biological activities of TNF alpha was assayed, T2 protein effectively protected L929-8 cells from lysis by rabbit, but not human or mouse TNF alpha. These studies show that rabbit TNF receptors may be species-specific for rabbit TNF alpha and we conclude that the myxoma T2 protein evolved to specifically inhibit TNF activities from its natural host, the South American rabbit.</ab>

<ab>The myxoma virus T2 (M-T2) gene expresses a secreted protein that contains significant sequence similarity to the ligand binding domains of the cellular tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors, specifically inhibits the cytolytic activity of rabbit TNFalpha and is an important virulence factor for myxoma virus infection in rabbits. M-T2 protein was overexpressed from vaccinia virus vectors, purified to apparent homogeneity, and found to specifically protect mouse and rabbit cells from lysis by rabbit TNFalpha at molar ratios comparable with the soluble versions of the host tumor necrosis factor receptors. M-T2 secreted from virus-infected cells is detected as both a monomer and a disulfide-linked dimer, both of which were shown by Scatchard analysis to bind rabbit TNFalpha (Kd values of 170 pM and 195 pM, respectively), values that are comparable with the affinities of mammalian TNFs with their receptors. In contrast to the rabbit ligand, M-T2 interacts with mouse TNFalpha with a much lower affinity, Kd of 1.7 nM, and was unable to inhibit the cytolytic activity of this ligand on mouse cells. Although both monomeric and dimeric forms bound rabbit TNFalpha with comparable affinity, the dimeric M-T2 protein was a far more potent inhibitor of rabbit TNFalpha, presumably because it can more effectively prevent dimerization of TNF receptors than can the M-T2 monomer.</ab>

<ab>Poxviruses are experts at manipulating and evading the host&amp;#39;s immune response. They have acquired a number of open reading frames which specifically confer direct anti-immune properties, either by mimicking cytokine receptors and growth factors or by disarming cytokine regulatory cascades. The Myxoma T2 protein (M-T2), a TNF receptor homologue, is secreted from virus infected cells and can bind TNF-alpha with high affinity, and thereby inhibit TNF-alpha-mediated cytotoxicity. M-T2 also acts to inhibit virus-induced lymphocyte apoptosis by an as yet undefined mechanism. As such, T2 constitutes a significant virulence factor for poxviruses, influencing the outcome of infection, both in vitro and in vivo.</ab>

<ab>The poxvirus tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) homologue T2 has immunomodulatory properties; secreted myxoma virus T2 (M-T2) protein binds and inhibits rabbit TNF-alpha, while intracellular M-T2 blocks virus-induced lymphocyte apoptosis. Here, we define the antiapoptotic function as inhibition of TNFR-mediated death via a highly conserved viral preligand assembly domain (vPLAD). Jurkat cell lines constitutively expressing M-T2 were generated and shown to be resistant to UV irradiation-, etoposide-, and cycloheximide-induced death. These cells were also resistant to human TNF-alpha, but M-T2 expression did not alter surface expression levels of TNFRs. Previous studies indicated that T2&amp;#39;s antiapoptotic function was conferred by the N-terminal region of the protein, and further examination of this region revealed a highly conserved N-terminal vPLAD, which is present in all poxvirus T2-like molecules. In cellular TNFRs and TNF-alpha-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors (TRAILRs), PLAD controls receptor signaling competency prior to ligand binding. Here, we show that M-T2 potently inhibits TNFR1-induced death in a manner requiring the M-T2 vPLAD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that M-T2 physically associates with and colocalizes with human TNFRs but does not prevent human TNF-alpha binding to cellular receptors. Thus, M-T2 vPLAD is a species-nonspecific dominant-negative inhibitor of cellular TNFR1 function. Given that the PLAD is conserved in all known poxvirus T2-like molecules, we predict that it plays an important function in each of these proteins. Moreover, that the vPLAD confers an important antiapoptotic function confirms this domain as a potential target in the development of the next generation of TNF-alpha/TNFR therapeutics.</ab>

<ab>Poxviruses encode a number of secreted virulence factors that function to mitigate or modulate the host immune response. M-T1 is a secreted 43-kDa glycoprotein produced by the myxoma virus, a poxvirus pathogen of rabbits, that binds CC-chemokines with high affinity, blocks binding to their cognate G-protein coupled receptors, and thereby inhibits chemokine-induced leukocyte chemotaxis. The present study indicates that M-T1, but not the related vaccinia virus 35-kDa CC-chemokine-binding protein, can localize to cell surfaces through an interaction with glycosaminoglycan molecules. In addition to biochemically characterizing the nature of this interaction, we demonstrate that M-T1 can also simultaneously interact with CC-chemokines while bound to heparin, suggesting that the binding sites on M-T1 for chemokines and heparin are distinct. Furthermore, using recombinant baculovirus-expressed M-T1 truncation and internal deletion mutants, we localize the heparin-binding region of M-T1 to the C terminus of the protein, a region that contains a high abundance of basic residues and includes two clusters of basic amino acid residues that resemble Cardin and Weintraub heparin-binding consensus sequences. The ability of M-T1 to simultaneously interact with chemokines and glycosaminoglycans may enable M-T1 to tether to endothelial surfaces or extracellular matrix and capture host chemokines that are expressed close to sites of virus infection.</ab>

<ab>Large DNA viruses defend against hostile assault executed by the host immune system by producing an array of gene products that systematically sabotage key components of the inflammatory response. Poxviruses target many of the primary mediators of innate immunity including interferons, tumor necrosis factors, interleukins, complement, and chemokines. Poxviruses also manipulate a variety of intracellular signal transduction pathways such as the apoptotic response. Many of the poxvirus genes that disrupt these pathways have been hijacked directly from the host immune system, while others have demonstrated no clear resemblance to any known host genes. Nonetheless, the immunological targets and the diversity of strategies used by poxviruses to disrupt these host pathways have provided important insights into diverse aspects of immunology, virology, and inflammation. Furthermore, because of their anti-inflammatory nature, many of these poxvirus proteins hold promise as potential therapeutic agents for acute or chronic inflammatory conditions.</ab>

<ab>We identify a secreted chemokine inhibitor encoded by orf virus (ORFV), the prototypic poxvirus of the Parapoxvirus genus, and show that it is related to the poxvirus type II CC-chemokine-binding proteins (CBP-II) produced by members of the Orthopoxvirus and Leporipoxvirus genera. The ORFV chemokine-binding protein (CBP) is functionally similar to the CBP-II proteins in its ability to bind and inhibit many CC-chemokines with high affinity. However, unlike CBP-II, the ORFV CBP also binds with high affinity to lymphotactin, a member of the C-chemokine family, demonstrating that the ORFV CBP possesses an altered binding specificity. Interestingly, the amino acid sequence of ORFV CBP more closely resembles the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor/IL-2 inhibitory factor also produced by ORFV, implicating the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor/IL-2 inhibitory factor protein as a highly diverged, but related, member of the CBP-II protein family. Notably, these findings suggest that the genes that encode these proteins derive from a common poxvirus ancestral gene that has since been modified in binding specificity during speciation of the poxvirus genera. Overall, these findings illustrate the concept of evolution of viral proteins at the biophysical and molecular interface.</ab>

<ab>Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensors have become an increasingly popular technology for characterizing the protein-protein interactions of virus-host interactions. Various studies have exploited the versatility of SPR to probe the interaction between virus and host components, including constituents of virus particles and host cellular receptors, as well as interactions between viral proteins and host immune molecules. This chapter describes basic procedures for employing SPR to study the interaction between poxvirus proteins and host immune-signaling proteins. We also identify how this methodology may be adapted toward other applications relevant in the study of poxvirus-host interactions.</ab>

<ab>The chemokines are a large family of small signaling proteins that bind to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) on target cells and mediate the directional migration of immune cells into sites of infection or inflammation. The large DNA viruses, particularly the poxviruses and herpesviruses, have evolved several mechanisms to corrupt the normal functioning of the chemokine network. Two strategies rely on mimicking chemokines or chemokine receptors. A third strategy involves the production of secreted chemokine-binding proteins (CKBPs) that exhibit no sequence similarity to any known host proteins, yet function to competitively bind and inhibit the interactions of chemokines with cognate receptors. Each strategy has provided unique insights into the elusively complex world of the chemokines. Here, we focus on recent advances made in the understanding of secreted CKBPs encoded by poxviruses and herpesviruses. A better understanding of how viral CKBPs function to manipulate the immune response may provide further clues as to how to develop specific therapeutic agents to abrogate chemokine-mediated disease conditions.</ab>

<ab>Poxviruses express a family of secreted proteins that bind with high affinity to chemokines and antagonize the interaction with their cognate G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These viral inhibitors are novel in structure and, unlike cellular chemokine receptors, are able to specifically interact with most, if not all, CC-chemokines. We therefore sought to define the structural features of CC-chemokines that facilitate this broad-spectrum interaction. Here, we identify the residues present on human monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) that are required for high-affinity interaction with the vaccinia virus 35-kDa CC-chemokine binding protein (VV-35kDa). Not only do these residues correspond to those required for interaction with the cognate receptor CCR2b but they are also conserved among many CC-chemokines. Thus, the results provide a structural basis for the ability of VV-35kDa to promiscuously recognize CC-chemokines and block binding to their receptors.</ab>

<ab>Transcription of the c-fos proto-oncogene is rapidly induced in the rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line by a wide variety of stimuli, including polypeptide growth factors, phorbol esters, and calcium ion fluxes. We have mapped the upstream sequence requirements for this activation in PC12 cells by analysis of promoter deletion mutants in a transient expression assay. Two distinct pathways of c-fos induction are defined that differ in their requirement for cis-acting DNA sequences. Calcium activation of c-fos transcription is dependent on a DNA element located approximately 60 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. This region is highly conserved between human, mouse, and chicken c-fos genes and contains a sequence that resembles the consensus for a cyclic AMP response element. The dyad symmetry element at position -300, which is necessary for serum responsiveness of c-fos, appears to be unimportant for calcium activation of the gene. The dyad symmetry element is, however, an essential cis-acting sequence for c-fos inducibility by nerve growth factor, epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate. Studies in vivo and in vitro with various mutants of the dyad symmetry element indicate that c-fos activation by polypeptide growth factors and 12-O-tetradecanoyl activation by polypeptide growth factors and 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate is mediated by a common transcription factor, and that this factor is identical to the previously described serum response factor. In vitro DNA-binding assays suggest that the quantity of serum response factor-binding activity remains unchanged during c-fos transcriptional activation.</ab>

<ab>The mechanism by which the calcium influx signal, triggered by membrane depolarization, is transduced to the nucleus to activate c-fos proto-oncogene transcription has been characterized. A calcium response element (CaRE) that is indistinguishable from a cAMP response element (CRE) mediates transcriptional inducibility by depolarization. Its cognate transcription factor CREB is the target for both calcium and cAMP signals. CREB is rapidly phosphorylated in response to depolarization or cAMP, at a site known to be important for the transcriptional activating function of this protein. The convergent effects of calcium and cAMP on CREB activation are mediated by distinct protein kinase signaling pathways. CREB and its binding site, the Ca/CRE, can thus function as a regulatory element that integrates both calcium and cAMP signals in the control of gene expression.</ab>

<ab>The participation of host RNA polymerase II in the vaccinia life cycle was examined by comparing efficiency of multiplication after treating the Ama+ sensitive and Ama 102 drug resistant lines with alpha-amanitin. In the latter, resistance is due to a mutation in RNA polymerase II. The toxin profoundly reduces synthesis of virus-specified polypeptides and morphopoeisis in Ama+ but not in Ama 102 rat myoblasts without appreciably altering vaccinia DNA replication in either cell type. This implicates RNA polymerase II in the expression of late virus functions. Circumstantial evidence from a model system indicates that gamma irradiation of the host prior to infection might disrupt transcription into functional mRNA from the nucleus. Irradiation does not, however, alter the capability of the host to support vaccinia multiplication fully. Therefore, ongoing host nuclear transcription may not be required by this virus. The above results are consistent with the ability of cytoplasts to produce small quantities of mature progeny. Our studies lead us to hypothesize that RNA polymerase II or a subunit of the host enzyme may participate directly in late transcription of the vaccinia genome.</ab>

<ab>Myxoma virus (MYXV) is a member of the Poxviridae family and prototype for the genus Leporipoxvirus. It is pathogenic only for European rabbits, in which it causes the lethal disease myxomatosis, and two North American species, in which it causes a less severe disease. MYXV replicates exclusively in the cytoplasm of the host cell. Although not infectious in humans, its genome encodes proteins that can interfere with or modulate host defense mechanisms; it is able to productively infect a number of human cancer cell lines, but not normal human cells, and has also been shown to increase survival time in mouse models of human glioma. These characteristics suggest that MYXV could be a viable therapeutic agent, e.g., in anti-inflammatory or anti-immune therapy, or as an oncolytic agent. MYXV is also an excellent model for poxvirus biology, pathogenesis, and host tropism studies. It is easily propagated in a number of cell lines, including adherent cells and suspension cultures, and minimal purification is required to provide a stock for in vivo and in vitro studies.</ab>

<ab>A transcriptionally active open reading frame (T2) from Shope Fibroma Virus was recently shown to have striking sequence homology with members of a new superfamily of cell surface proteins, including a receptor for human tumor necrosis factor. Here we report that recombinant T2 protein expressed in COS cells is a soluble, secreted glycoprotein which specifically binds human TNF alpha and beta, and inhibits binding of these cytokines to native TNF receptors on cells. T2 binding of TNF is not inhibited by nerve growth factor, although the nerve growth factor receptor is also a member of the same family, nor by nine other recombinant cytokines. Further, the repeating domain structure of T2 most closely resembles that of the type I TNF receptor (p75) and is significantly different from other family members, including the type II TNF receptor (p55). Since T2 possesses a leader sequence but lacks a transmembrane domain, these results confirm the original suggestion (1) that T2 represents a soluble form of the type I TNF receptor which is secreted from virally infected cells, and whose function is to immunosuppress the host by abrogating the potentially destructive effects of TNF. This is the first such virally-encoded soluble cytokine receptor to be identified, and may represent a more general mechanism by which viruses subvert the host immune system.</ab>

<ab>Smallpox was eradicated in 1977, but it remains a concern owing to the potential use of the causative agent variola virus in bioterrorism. This article provides an overview of the World Health Organization&amp;#39;s spectacular success in achieving the eradication of smallpox. It discusses how variola virus could potentially re-emerge and how prepared we are to counter such a re-emergence. Finally, the potential threat from other orthopoxviruses that exist naturally or that have been genetically engineered is considered. In the words of Rep. Christopher Shay, &amp;#39;Better to be scared by the improbable possibility than to be unprepared for the catastrophic reality&amp;#39;.</ab>

<ab>Myxoma virus (MV) is a candidate for oncolytic virotherapy due to its ability to selectively infect and kill tumor cells, yet MV is a species-specific pathogen that causes disease only in European rabbits. To assess the ability of MV to deliver cytokines to tumors, we created an MV (vMyxIL-12) that expresses human interleukin-12 (IL-12). vMyxIL-12 replicates similarly to wild-type MV, and virus-infected cells secrete bioactive IL-12. Yet, vMyxIL-12 does not cause myxomatosis, despite expressing the complete repertoire of MV proteins. Thus, vMyxIL-12 exhibits promise as an oncolytic candidate and is safe in all known vertebrate hosts, including lagomorphs.</ab>

<ab>Myxoma virus is a rabbit-specific poxvirus pathogen that also exhibits a unique tropism for human tumor cells and is dramatically oncolytic for human cancer xenografts. Most tumor cell lines tested are permissive for myxoma infection in a fashion intimately tied to the activation state of Akt kinase. A host range factor of myxoma virus, M-T5, directly interacts with Akt and mediates myxoma virus tumor cell tropism. mTOR is a regulator of cell growth and metabolism downstream of Akt and is specifically inhibited by rapamycin. We report that treatment of nonpermissive human tumor cell lines, which normally restrict myxoma virus replication, with rapamycin dramatically increased virus tropism and spread in vitro. This increased myxoma replication is concomitant with global effects on mTOR signaling, specifically, an increase in Akt kinase. In contrast to the effects on human cancer cells, rapamycin does not increase myxoma virus replication in rabbit cell lines or permissive human tumor cell lines with constitutively active Akt. This indicates that rapamycin increases the oncolytic capacity of myxoma virus for human cancer cells by reconfiguring the internal cell signaling environment to one that is optimal for productive virus replication and suggests the possibility of a potentially therapeutic synergism between kinase signaling inhibitors and oncolytic poxviruses for cancer treatment.</ab>

<ab>The field of oncolytic virus (OV) therapy is an innovative and evolving science, taking advantage of the ability of select viruses to preferentially infect and kill human tumor cells. However, the contribution of the tumor microenvironment, and especially the induced innate immune responses to both the tumor and the virus, has been demonstrated to be a major player in the success of OV therapies. Innate immunity and inflammation in particular can have opposing effects; these can augment OV therapy by enhancing tumor destruction, yet can also recognize and clear the invading virus to significantly hinder viral dissemination through the tumor tissues. This review considers how inflammation and innate immunity impinge on current OV candidates to either facilitate or hinder virotherapy. Novel approaches that modulate or harness the innate immune system to specifically enhance OV-mediated tumor destruction are also discussed.</ab>

<ab>Oncolytic virotherapy is an innovative alternative to more conventional cancer therapies. The ability of some viruses to specifically target and kill malignant cancerous cells while leaving normal tissue unscathed has opened a large repertoire of new and selective cancer killing therapeutic candidates. Poxviruses, such as vaccinia virus, have a long history of use in humans as live vaccines and have more recently been studied as potential platforms for delivery of immunotherapeutics and attenuated variants of vaccinia have been explored as oncolytic candidates. In contrast, the poxvirus myxoma virus is a novel oncolytic candidate that has no history of use in humans directly, as it has a distinct and absolute host species tropism to lagomorphs (rabbits). Myxoma virus has been recently shown to be able to also selectively infect and kill human tumor cells, a unique tropism that is linked to dysregulated intracellular signalling pathways found in the majority of human cancers. This review outlines the existing knowledge on the tropism of myxoma virus for human cancer cells, as well as preclinical data exhibiting its ability to infect and clear tumors in animal models of cancer. This is an exciting new therapeutic option for treating cancer, and myxoma virus joins a growing group of oncolytic virus candidates that are being developed as a new class of cancer therapies in man.</ab>

<ab>Members of the Poxviridae family are particularly adept at avoiding the host immune system, encoding a plethora of immunomodulatory proteins that subvert host defense. With their large genome, poxviruses are also useful for studying the effect of exogenous genes on virus-host interactions and immune responses. The insertion of the Th2 cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) into several poxviruses significantly increases the efficiency of the recombinant virus as a pathogen by directly inhibiting the development of Th1 immunity, which is crucial for viral clearance. In an age in which the fear of genetically modified weaponized pathogens exists, the understanding of how to make viruses more pathogenic further blurs the distinction between fundamental academic research and bioweapons development. Here, the extent of immune evasion by IL-4-expressing poxviruses will be explored, as will the consequences of this increased pathogenicity on protective immune responses.</ab>

<ab>Variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, is a member of the poxvirus family and one of the most virulent human pathogens known. Although smallpox was eradicated almost 30 years ago, it is not understood why the mortality rates associated with the disease were high, why some patients recovered, and what constitutes an effective host response against infection. As variola virus infects only humans, our current understanding of poxvirus infections comes largely from historical clinical data from smallpox patients and from animal studies using closely related viruses such as ectromelia, myxoma and monkeypox. The outcome of an infection is determined by a complex interaction between the type of immune response mounted by the host and by evasion mechanisms that the virus has evolved to subvert it. Disease pathogenesis is also a function of both host and viral factors. Poxviruses are not only cytopathic, causing host tissue damage, but also encode an array of immunomodulatory molecules that affect the severity of disease. The ability of the host to control virus replication is therefore critical in limiting tissue damage. However, in addition to targeting virus, the immune response can inadvertently damage the host to such a degree that it causes illness and even death. There is growing evidence that many of the symptoms associated with serious poxvirus infections are a result of a &amp;#39;cytokine storm&amp;#39; or sepsis and that this may be the underlying cause of pathology.</ab>

<ab>Myxoma virus (MV) is a rabbit-specific poxvirus, whose unexpected tropism to human cancer cells has led to studies exploring its potential use in oncolytic therapy. MV infects a wide range of human cancer cells in vitro, in a manner intricately linked to the cellular activation of Akt kinase. MV has also been successfully used for treating human glioma xenografts in immunodeficient mice. This study examines the effectiveness of MV in treating primary and metastatic mouse tumors in immunocompetent C57BL6 mice. We have found that several mouse tumor cell lines, including B16 melanomas, are permissive to MV infection. B16F10 cells were used for assessing MV replication and efficacy in syngeneic primary tumor and metastatic models in vivo. Multiple intratumoral injections of MV resulted in dramatic inhibition of tumor growth. Systemic administration of MV in a lung metastasis model with B16F10LacZ cells was dramatically effective in reducing lung tumor burden. Combination therapy of MV with rapamycin reduced both size and number of lung metastases, and also reduced the induced antiviral neutralizing antibody titres, but did not affect tumor tropism. These results show MV to be a promising virotherapeutic agent in immunocompetent animal tumor models, with good efficacy in combination with rapamycin.</ab>

<ab>Myxoma virus (MV) is a poxvirus that evolved in Sylvilagus lagomorphs, and is the causative agent of myxomatosis in European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). This virus is not a natural pathogen of O. cuniculus, yet is able to subvert the host rabbit immune system defenses and cause a highly lethal systemic infection. The interaction of MV proteins and the rabbit immune system has been an ideal model to help elucidate host/poxvirus interactions, and has led to a greater understanding of how other poxvirus pathogens are able to cause disease in their respective hosts. This review will examine how MV causes myxomatosis, by examining a selection of the identified immunomodulatory proteins that this virus expresses to subvert the immune and inflammatory pathways of infected rabbit hosts.</ab>

<ab>Available evidence suggests that one or more late viral gene products are involved in processing poxvirus replicative intermediates into mature progeny hairpin-terminated genomes. Cloned versions of the Shope fibroma virus (SFV) replicated telomere in the inverted repeat configuration were used as substrates to assay lysates from poxvirus-infected cells for protein fractions that participate in the resolution of the circular substrate plasmid into a linear minichromosome with viral hairpin termini. An activity in a crude protein fraction obtained from vaccinia virus-infected cells at late times during the replicative cycle was capable of accurately resolving all poxviral inverted repeat replicative intermediates tested. The resolved linear products are identical to the products of in vivo resolution and possessed symmetrical nicks which mapped at the borders of the inverted repeat sequence. Strand-specific nicks were also identified, which mapped within the telomere resolution target sequence known to be required for telomere resolution in vivo. The resolving activity that we have identified is specific to virus-infected cells at late times during replication and cleaves cloned poxviral telomeric substrates in a fashion expected of a classic Holliday junction-resolving enzyme in addition to possessing a telomere resolution target-specific nicking activity. Although a Holliday junction-resolving activity would also be expected to play a role in the recombination induced by poxvirus infection, the appearance of the activity described here only after the commencement of viral late protein synthesis suggests that it functions strictly at late times. Other non-viral Holliday junction analogs can also be cleaved by this extract, suggesting that this component of the resolution activity may also play a role in other viral processes that require cleavage of a branched DNA structure. Thus, we have identified a poxviral activity that may be a part of a protein complex which resolves concatemeric replicative intermediates of viral DNA as well as participate in general recombination late during infection.</ab>

<ab>The linear double-stranded genomes of poxviruses such as Shope fibroma virus (SFV) replicate autonomously within the cytoplasm of infected cells, and it is believed that all of the replication functions are virally encoded. During DNA replication the incompletely base-paired terminal hairpin loops of the viral genome transiently exist in the form of inverted repeat replicative intermediates. These inverted repeat structures form the target for telomere resolution events that include sequence-specific cleavage and directed strand exchange to form the hairpin termini of progeny virus genomes. The terminal sequence domain which forms the telomere resolution target (TRT) shares considerable sequence similarity with viral late promoters. In this study we demonstrate that the TRT of SFV is capable of functioning as a strong viral promoter late in infection. A spectrum of TRT mutations affects telomere resolution and late transcription in a strictly concordant fashion, suggesting that the two activities may be inextricably linked. Further support for this concept comes from the demonstration that a late SFV promoter sequence designated cryptic TRT, which differs substantially from the native TRT in terms of sequence, can support telomere resolution when placed in the correct spatial context. The proposed model for telomere resolution invokes directed unwinding of the TRT double helix by a transcription initiation complex and processing of the resulting secondary structure by viral late-gene products.</ab>

<ab>Infection of cultured mammalian cells with the Leporipoxvirus Shope fibroma virus (SFV) causes the induction of a novel uracil DNA glycosylase activity in the cytoplasms of the infected cells. The induction of this activity, early in infection, correlates with the early expression of the SFV BamHI D6R open reading frame which possesses significant protein sequence similarity to eukaryotic and prokaryotic uracil DNA glycosylases. The SFV BamHI D6R open reading frame and the homologous HindIII D4R open reading frame from the Orthopoxvirus vaccinia virus were cloned under the regulation of a phage T7 promoter and expressed in Escherichia coli as insoluble high-molecular-weight aggregates. During electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, the E. coli-expressed proteins migrate with an apparent molecular mass of 25 kDa. The insoluble protein aggregate generated by expression in E. coli was solubilized in urea and, following a subsequent refolding step, displayed the ability to excise uracil residues from double-stranded plasmid DNA substrates, with the subsequent formation of apyrimidinic sites. The viral enzyme, like all other characterized uracil DNA glycosylases, is active in the presence of high concentrations of EDTA, is substrate inhibited by uracil, and does not display any endonuclease activity. Attempts to inactivate the HindIII D4R gene of vaccinia virus by targeted insertion of a dominant xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase selection marker or direct insertion of a frame-shifted oligonucleotide were uniformly unsuccessful demonstrating that, unlike the uracil DNA glycosylase described for herpesviruses, the poxvirus enzyme is essential for virus viability.</ab>

<ab>Many viruses inhibit or retard apoptosis, a strategy that subverts one of the most ancient antiviral mechanisms. M11L, a myxoma virus-encoded antiapoptotic protein, has been previously shown to localize to mitochondria and block apoptosis of virus-infected cells (H. Everett, M. Barry, S. F. Lee, X. J. Sun, K. Graham, J. Stone, R. C. Bleackley, and G. McFadden, J. Exp. Med. 191:1487-1498, 2000; H. Everett, M. Barry, X. Sun, S. F. Lee, C. Frantz, L. G. Berthiaume, G. McFadden, and R. C. Bleackley, J. Exp. Med. 196:1127-1139, 2002; and G. Wang, J. W. Barrett, S. H. Nazarian, H. Everett, X. Gao, C. Bleackley, K. Colwill, M. F. Moran, and G. McFadden, J. Virol. 78:7097-7111, 2004). This protection from apoptosis involves constitutive-forming inhibitory complexes with the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor and Bak on the outer mitochondrial membrane. Here, we extend the study to investigate the interference of M11L with Bax activation during the process of apoptosis. Myxoma virus infection triggers an early apoptotic signal that induces rapid Bax translocation from cytoplasm to mitochondria, despite the existence of various viral antiapoptotic proteins. However, in the presence of M11L, the structural activation of Bax at the mitochondrial membrane, which is characterized by the occurrence of a Bax conformational change, is blocked in both M11L-expressing myxoma-infected cells and M11L-transfected cells under apoptotic stimulation. In addition, inducible binding of M11L to the mitochondrially localized Bax is detected in myxoma virus-infected cells and in M11L/Bax-cotransfected cells as measured by immunoprecipitation and tandem affinity purification analysis, respectively. Importantly, this inducible Bax/M11L interaction is independent of Bak, demonstrated by the complete block of Bax-mediated apoptosis in myxoma-infected cells that lack Bak expression. Our findings reveal that myxoma M11L modulates apoptosis by multiple independent strategies which all contribute to the blockade of apoptosis at the mitochondrial checkpoint.</ab>

<ab>A current goal of vaccine development against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is to develop a strategy that stimulates long-lasting memory T-cell responses, and provides immediate cytotoxicity in response to viral challenge. We demonstrate that the viral antiapoptotic molecule M11L promotes cellular immune responses to the HIV envelope protein. Coexpression of M11L in vitro inhibits gp140-mediated apoptosis and increases gp140 expression levels. Mice primed with M11L-pHERO DNA, followed by vCP205 boosting, exhibit significantly greater HIV-specific T-cell responses. Moreover, M11L synergizes with CpG motifs to augment anti-HIV responses and stimulates robust expansion of central memory and effector memory CD8(+) T-cells. Inclusion of M11L in a DNA vector increases the magnitude of T-cell responses, and promotes the generation of memory T-cells that provide rapid-responding CTL responses. This vaccine strategy may facilitate the generation of an efficacious vaccine for HIV, and other chronic diseases that require enhanced cell-mediated immunity, including HCV and metastatic cancer.</ab>

<ab>A novel member of the serpin family of serine protease inhibitors is presented. A plasmid-like DNA was isolated from rabbit cells by its homology to the genome of Shope fibroma virus (SFV), a tumorigenic poxvirus of rabbits, and was shown elsewhere to encode a serpin-like protein [(1986) Mol. Cell. Biol. 6, 265-276]. Although significant DNA homology exists between the rabbit plasmid serpin open reading frame and the SFV terminal inverted repeat DNA there is no intact serpin counterpart encoded by this region of the SFV genome. The alignment of the novel plasmid-borne polypeptide with the serpin family of proteins confirms its status within this group.</ab>

<ab>Shope fibroma virus (SFV), a tumorigenic poxvirus, has a 160-kb linear double-stranded DNA genome and possesses terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) of 12.4 kb. The DNA sequence of the terminal 5.5 kb of the viral genome is presented and together with previously published sequences completes the entire sequence of the SFV TIR. The terminal 400-bp region contains no major open reading frames (ORFs) but does possess five related imperfect palindromes. The remaining 5.1 kb of the sequence contains seven tightly clustered and tandemly oriented ORFs, four larger than 100 amino acids in length (T1, T2, T4, and T5) and three smaller ORFs (T3A, T3B, and T3C). All are transcribed toward the viral hairpin and almost all possess the consensus sequence TTTTTNT near their 3&amp;#39; ends which has been implicated for the transcription termination of vaccinia virus early genes. Searches of the published DNA database revealed no sequences with significant homology with this region of the SFV genome but when the protein database was searched with the translation products of ORFs T1-T5 it was found that the N-terminus of the putative T4 polypeptide is closely related to the signal sequence of the hemagglutinin precursor from influenza A virus, suggesting that the T4 polypeptide may be secreted from SFV-infected cells. Examination of other SFV ORFs shows that T1 and T2 also possess signal-like hydrophobic amino acid stretches close to their N-termini. The protein database search also revealed that the putative T2 protein has significant homology to the insulin family of polypeptides. In terms of sequence repetitions, seven tandemly repeated copies of the hexanucleotide ATTGTT and three flanking regions of dyad symmetry were detected, all in ORF T3C. A search for palindromic sequences also revealed two clusters, one in ORF T3A/B and a second in ORF T2. ORF T2 harbors five short sequence domains, each of which consists of a 6-bp short palindrome and a 10- to 18-bp larger palindrome. The significance of these palindromic domains in this ORF is unclear but the coincidence of the end of one larger palindrome with the end of the translated protein sequence that has homology with the B chain of insulin suggests that the palindromes may divide the T2 protein into several functional units. The salient organizational features of the complete SFV TIR are also discussed in light of what is known about other poxviral TIRs.</ab>

<ab>Malignant rabbit fibroma virus (MRV) has been shown to be a lethal tumorigenic poxvirus of rabbits derived from a recombination event between Shope fibroma virus (SFV), which induces benign fibromas in rabbits, and myxoma virus, the agent of myxomatosis. We have cloned and sequenced all of the MRV recombination junctions, which are located near the left and right terminal inverted repeat (TIR) regions, and present a composite map of the MRV genome with respect to the relevant gene products. The two junctions closet to the MRV termini, at identical positions at the left and right ends, are at nucleotide 5272 and result in an in-frame fusion protein (ORF T-5) in which the N-terminal 232 aa are derived from an SFV sequence linked to a C-terminus derived from myxoma. At the left MRV TIR the recombination junction distal from the terminus maps to nucleotide 9946 but leaves the adjacent gene virtually unchanged from its SFV homolog. At the right terminus, the relevant junction sequences from MRV and myxoma could not be cloned in wild-type Escherichia coli but were maintained stably in a recA recBC sbcB host. The SFV/myxoma junction at this location maps 5&amp;#39; to a growth factor gene (SFGF) which is related to those encoding epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor-alpha. As a result, the myxoma growth factor gene has been deleted in MRV and replaced in toto by the SFV gene. The recombination junction upstream from the SFGF gene creates an in-frame fusion in ORF T11-R in which the N-terminal amino acids are derived from myxoma and the remainder from SFV. In summary, MRV has received the following ORFs from SFV: at the left terminus T5 (fusion), T6, T7, and T8; at the right terminus, T5 (fusion), T6, T7, T8, T9-R, SFGF, and T11-R (fusion).</ab>

<ab>Myxoma virus, a Leporipoxvirus and agent of myxomatosis, was shown to possess a gene with the potential to encode an epidermal growth factorlike factor. Its relationship to other members of this family, including the poxvirus growth factors from Shope fibroma virus and vaccinia virus, was analyzed. Alignment of DNA sequences and related open reading frames of myxoma virus and Shope fibroma virus indicated colinearity of genes between these poxviruses.</ab>

<k1>Virulence</k1>
<ab>Poxviruses are known to contain a large number of open reading frames, particularly near the termini of the viral genome, that are not required for growth in tissue culture. However, many of these gene products are believed to play important roles in determining the virulence of the virus by modulating the host immune response to the infection. Recently it has been shown that Shope fibroma virus encodes, within the terminal inverted repeats, a protein (T2) related to the cellular tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) and which specifically binds both TNF alpha and TNF beta. We have sequenced the terminal regions of two other Leporipoxviruses (myxoma virus and malignant rabbit fibroma virus) that are extremely invasive and capable of inducing extensive immunosuppression in rabbits and demonstrate that they also encode a closely related T2 homolog with all the structural motifs predicted for a secreted TNF binding protein. To investigate the biological role of the T2 protein, we have inactivated the myxoma virus T2 gene within each copy of the viral TIR by the insertion of a dominant selectable marker (Escherichia coli guanosine phosphoribosyltransferase) and selection of the recombinant virus in the presence of mycophenolic acid. The success of the inactivation of both copies of T2 was confirmed by the loss a broad protein band (52-56 kDa) of the predicted size for T2 from the profile of proteins secreted from mutant virus-infected BGMK cells at early times after infection. Although the T2-minus recombinant myxoma virus grew normally in tissue culture, upon infection of susceptible rabbits the viral disease was observed to be significantly attenuated. The majority of infected rabbits were able to mount an effective immune response to the infection and completely recovered. These survivor rabbits became immune to subsequent challenge with wild type myxoma virus. We conclude that the T2 viral protein is an important secreted virulence factor and that it in all likelihood functions by compromising the antiviral effects of TNF. We propose the term &amp;quot;viroceptor&amp;quot; to describe viral-encoded homologs of cellular lymphokine receptors whose function is to intercept the activity of the cognate lymphokine in order to short circuit the host immune response to the viral infection.</ab>

<ab>The leporipoxviruses Shope fibroma virus (SFV), the myxoma virus (MYX), and the SFV/MYX recombinant malignant rabbit fibroma virus (MRV) are closely related yet induce profoundly different diseases in the European rabbit. SFV, which produces a benign tumor at the site of inoculation, is cleared by the immune system after approximately 2 weeks whereas MYX and MRV induce a rapidly lethal systemic infection characterized by generalized suppression of host immune functions. DNA sequencing studies reveal that MRV and MYX possess homologous gene members of the T6/T8/T9 family originally described in the terminal inverted repeat (TIR) of SFV. We also describe a gene present in both MYX and MRV genomes, but which has apparently evolved in the SFV genome into a fragmented pseudogene that appears to contribute to the aggressive nature of MYX and MRV infections. Translation of this open reading frame, designated MYXOMA SERPIN 1 (SERP1), reveals a protein sequence with highly significant homology to the super-family of serine protease inhibitors (serpins) which also includes a number of other poxviral proteins. In the MYX genome the SERP1 gene lies entirely within the TIR sequences and is thus present as two copies, while in the MRV genome SERP1 is present in the unique sequences adjacent to the TIR boundary and hence is a single copy. The amino acid homology between the putative active site of SERP1 and those of other serpins predicts that the target enzyme will be different from the known catalog of serine antiprotease substrates. Deletion of this gene from MRV significantly attenuates the disease spectrum induced by the normally lethal virus. Although the MRV-S1 deletion construct (MRV with SERP1 gene deleted) grows in all tissue culture cells tested in a fashion identical to the MRV parent, the majority of rabbits infected with MRV-S1 are able to mount an effective immune response and totally recover from the virus infection to become resistant to subsequent challenge by MRV or MYX.</ab>

<ab>DNA hybridization experiments indicate that the genome of a tumorigenic poxvirus. Shope fibroma virus (SFV), possesses sequence homology with DNA isolated from uninfected rabbit cells. Southern blotting experiments, either with high-complexity rabbit DNA as probe and SFV restriction fragments as targets or with high-specific activity, 32P-labeled, cloned SFV sequences as probes and rabbit DNA as target, indicate that the homologous sequences map at two locations within the viral genome, one in each copy of the terminal inverted repeat sequences. Unexpectedly, Southern blots revealed that the homologous host sequences reside in a rabbit extrachromosomal DNA element. This autonomous low-molecular-weight DNA species could be specifically amplified by cycloheximide treatment and was shown by isopycnic centrifugation in cesium chloride-ethidium bromide to consist predominantly of covalently closed circular DNA molecules. DNA sequencing of pSIC-9, a cloned 1.9-kilobase fragment of the rabbit plasmid species, indicated extensive homology at the nucleotide level over a 1.5-kilobase stretch of the viral terminal inverted repeat. Analysis of open reading frames in both the plasmid and SFV DNA revealed that (i) the N-terminal 157-amino acid sequence of a potential 514-amino acid SFV polypeptide is identical to the N-terminal 157 amino acids of one pSIC-9 open reading frame, and (ii) a second long pSIC-9 open reading frame of 361 amino acids, although significantly diverged from the comparable nucleotide sequence in the virus, possessed considerable homology to a family of cellular protease inhibitors, including alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and antithrombin III. The potential role of such cellular plasmid-like DNA species as a mediator in the exchange of genetic information between the host cell and a cytoplasmically replicating poxvirus is discussed.</ab>

<ab>The thymidine kinase (TK) gene of Shope fibroma virus (SFV), a tumorigenic leporipoxvirus, was localized within the viral genome with degenerate oligonucleotide probes. These probes were constructed to two regions of high sequence conservation between the vaccinia virus TK gene and those of several known eucaryotic cellular TK genes, including human, mouse, hamster, and chicken TK genes. The oligonucleotide probes initially localized the SFV TK gene 50 kilobases (kb) from the right terminus of the 160-kb SFV genome within the 9.5-kb BamHI-HindIII fragment E. Fine-mapping analysis indicated that the TK gene was within a 1.2-kb AvaI-HaeIII fragment, and DNA sequencing of this region revealed an open reading frame capable of encoding a polypeptide of 176 amino acids possessing considerable homology to the TK genes of the vaccinia, variola, and monkeypox orthopoxviruses and also to a variety of cellular TK genes. Homology matrix analysis and homology scores suggest that the SFV TK gene has diverged significantly from its counterpart members in the orthopoxvirus genus. Nevertheless, the presence of conserved upstream open reading frames on the 5&amp;#39; side of all of the poxvirus TK genes indicates a similarity of functional organization between the orthopoxviruses and leporipoxviruses. These data suggest a common ancestral origin for at least some of the unique internal regions of the leporipoxviruses and orthopoxviruses as exemplified by SFV and vaccinia virus, respectively.</ab>

<ab>The DNA sequence has been determined for a 7-kb region within the terminal inverted repeats (TIR) of Shope fibroma virus (SFV), a poxvirus which induces benign fibromas in rabbits. This region of the SFV TIR, which flanks the junction of the TIR with the unique internal sequences of the viral genome, had previously been shown to be also present in the genome of malignant rabbit virus (MRV), a hybrid poxvirus derived from a recombination event between SFV and a related leporipoxvirus, myxoma. Unlike SFV, the recombinant MRV induces an invasive profile of tumors in infected rabbits, but the capacity to induce proliferant fibromas appears to have been derived from SFV. These SFV DNA sequences have been analyzed and their genetic organization shows a unique tandem arrangement of three large open reading frames (ORFs) which share considerable homology with each other. Very short spacer sequences are present between the majority of ORFs, all of which are transcribed toward the terminal hairpins of SFV. Unusual dyad symmetries flank two of the most closely related ORFs and evidence is presented that one SFV ORF (T9-L) which maps precisely at the TIR/unique sequence boundary was truncated during transposition to the left terminus from a progenitor copy (T9-R) at the right terminus. The origin of these putative viral genes is considered in light of the recent observation (C. Upton and G. McFadden, 1986, Mol. Cell. Biol. 6, 265-276) that a subset of this region of the SFV genome is closely related to, and may have been originally derived from, an endogenous covalently closed circular plasmid species detected in uninfected rabbit cells.</ab>

<ab>Many poxvirus-encoded virulence factors have been identified as proteins that are secreted from infected cells. The major secreted protein (37 kilodaltons) from cells infected with myxoma virus is encoded by the M-T7 open reading frame. This protein has significant sequence similarity to the human and mouse receptors for interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Furthermore, the myxoma M-T7 protein specifically binds rabbit IFN-gamma and inhibits the biological activity of extracellular IFN-gamma, one of the key regulatory cytokines in the host immune response against viral infections.</ab>

<ab>The Shope fibroma virus (SFV) DNA topoisomerase gene has been identified and mapped to the BamHI D fragment near the midpoint of the genome. The DNA sequence of the SFV BamHI S fragment together with the contiguous BamHI-ClaI subfragment of BamHI D which encompasses the topoisomerase gene and two flanking genes has been determined and analyzed. Both the SFV DNA topoisomerase and the two flanking genes are closely related in terms of sequence and spatial organization to the homologous sequences from the midpoint of the vaccinia virus genome, indicating that these proteins are conserved not only in their sequence but also by position within the poxvirus genome. To confirm the assignment of the SFV gene, the putative SFV DNA topoisomerase has been expressed as an active fusion protein in Escherichia coli and this system should be useful in the analysis of topoisomerase function following the introduction of targeted mutations into the topoisomerase gene. The results of this work shed further light on the evolutionary relationship of the different poxvirus genera and indicate that central unique regions of the poxvirus genomes contain many of the essential viral genes and are thus highly conserved.</ab>

<ab>Shope fibroma virus (SFV) is a Leporipoxvirus closely related to the highly virulent myxoma virus. The DNA sequence of the BamHI N fragment of the SFV DNA genome was determined, and the single complete open reading frame (N1R) was characterized. The protein encoded by the N1R gene was found to contain a C3HC4 RING finger motif at the C terminus. This C3HC4 motif is the hallmark of a growing family of proteins, many of which are involved in regulation of gene expression, DNA repair, or DNA recombination. Complete homologs of the SFV N1R gene were also detected in variola virus, myxoma virus, and vaccinia virus strain IHD-W. In contrast, the gene is completely absent from vaccinia virus strain Copenhagen, and in vaccinia virus strain WR, the open reading frame is truncated prior to the zinc binding domain because of an 11-bp deletion, thus producing a frameshift and premature stop codon. Recombinant N1R protein from SFV was expressed in Escherichia coli and shown to bind zinc in a specific manner. Using fluorescence microscopy to visualize a peptide epitope tag (derived from ICP27 of herpes simplex virus) fused to the N terminus of the poxvirus proteins, we observed that the N1R protein of SFV and its homologs in myxoma virus and vaccinia virus IHD-W were localized primarily to the virus factories in the cytoplasm of infected cells and, to a lesser degree, the host cell nucleus. The truncated protein of vaccinia virus strain WR failed to localize in this manner but instead was observed throughout the cytoplasm.</ab>

<ab>A 3.6-kb region of the Shope fibroma virus (SFV) BamHI D fragment located in the central region of the viral genome was sequenced. Three open reading frames (ORFs) were identified, D3R, D4L, and D5R. Each of these ORFs have a counterpart organized identically within the HindIII fragment D of the vaccinia virus genome (D1R, D2L, and D3R). Homology scores and assays of viral cores indicate that SFV D3R encodes the large subunit of the SFV mRNA capping enzyme.</ab>

<ab>An open reading frame, BamHI D6R, from the central highly conserved region of the Shope fibroma virus (SFV) genome was sequenced and found to have significant homology to that of uracil DNA glycosylases from a number of organisms. Uracil DNA glycosylase catalyzes the initial step in the repair pathway that removes potentially mutagenic uracil from duplex DNA. The D6R polypeptide was expressed in reticulocyte lysates programmed with RNA transcribed from an expression vector containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. A highly specific ethidium bromide fluorescence assay of the in vitro translation product determined that the encoded protein does indeed possess uracil DNA glycosylase activity. Open reading frames from other poxviruses, including vaccinia virus (HindIII D4R) and fowlpox (D4), are highly homologous to D6R of SFV and are predicted to encode uracil DNA glycosylases. Identification of the SFV uracil DNA glycosylase provides evidence that this poxviral protein is involved in the repair of the viral DNA genome. Since this enzyme performs only the initial step required for the removal of uracil from DNA, creating an apyrimidinic site, we suggest that other, possibly virus-encoded, repair activities must be present in the cytoplasm of infected cells to complete the uracil excision repair pathway.</ab>

<ab>Chemokines are involved in recruitment and activation of hematopoietic cells at sites of infection and inflammation. The M3 gene of gammaHV68, a gamma-2 herpesvirus that infects and establishes a lifelong latent infection and chronic vasculitis in mice, encodes an abundant secreted protein during productive infection. The M3 gene is located in a region of the genome that is transcribed during latency. We report here that the M3 protein is a high-affinity broad-spectrum chemokine scavenger. The M3 protein bound the CC chemokines human regulated upon activation of normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), murine macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP-1alpha), and murine monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), as well as the human CXC chemokine interleukin-8, the murine C chemokine lymphotactin, and the murine CX(3)C chemokine fractalkine with high affinity (K(d) = 1. 6 to 18.7 nM). M3 protein chemokine binding was selective, since the protein did not bind seven other CXC chemokines (K(d) &amp;gt; 1 microM). Furthermore, the M3 protein abolished calcium signaling in response to murine MIP-1alpha and murine MCP-1 and not to murine KC or human stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), consistent with the binding data. The M3 protein was also capable of blocking the function of human CC and CXC chemokines, indicating the potential for therapeutic applications. Since the M3 protein lacks homology to known chemokines, chemokine receptors, or chemokine binding proteins, these studies suggest a novel herpesvirus mechanism of immune evasion.</ab>

<ab>Studies of the functional proteins encoded by the poxvirus genome provide information about the composition of the virus as well as individual virus-virus protein and virus-host protein interactions, which provides insight into viral pathogenesis and drug discovery. Widely used proteomic techniques to identify and characterize specific protein-protein interactions include yeast two-hybrid studies and coimmunoprecipitations. Recently, various mass spectrometry techniques have been employed to identify viral protein components of larger complexes. These methods, combined with structural studies, can provide new information about the putative functions of viral proteins as well as insights into virus-host interaction dynamics. For viral proteins of unknown function, identification of either viral or host binding partners provides clues about their putative function. In this review, we discuss poxvirus proteomics, including the use of proteomic methodologies to identify viral components and virus-host protein interactions. High-throughput global protein expression studies using protein chip technology as well as new methods for validating putative protein-protein interactions are also discussed.</ab>

<ab>Myxoma (MYXV) and vaccinia (VACV) viruses have recently emerged as potential oncolytic agents that can infect and kill different human cancer cells. Although both are structurally similar, it is unknown whether the pathway(s) used by these poxviruses to enter and cause oncolysis in cancer cells are mechanistically similar. Here, we compared the entry of MYXV and VACV-WR into various human cancer cells and observed significant differences: 1--low-pH treatment accelerates fusion-mediated entry of VACV but not MYXV, 2--the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein inhibits entry of VACV, but not MYXV, 3--knockdown of PAK1 revealed that it is required for a late stage event downstream of MYXV entry into cancer cells, whereas PAK1 is required for VACV entry into the same target cells. These results suggest that VACV and MYXV exploit different mechanisms to enter into human cancer cells, thus providing some rationale for their divergent cancer cell tropisms.</ab>

<ab>Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) are a widely used cell culture system in life sciences, including virology. Here, we show that although primary MEFs are nonpermissive to myxoma virus replication, the corresponding immortalized MEFs support a highly productive myxoma virus infection. We further demonstrate that this permissive phenotype for myxoma virus in immortalized MEFs is due to the immortalization-associated selective block to the cellular alpha/beta interferon induction machinery involved in responding to myxoma virus challenge. Thus, our report presents a clear example, illustrating that a drastic phenotypic alteration can occur with respect to virus infection between primary cells and their immortalized counterparts.</ab>

<ab>Poxviruses currently are known to disrupt Jak-STAT signal transduction induced by interferon (IFN) through two distinct mechanisms: (1) secreted poxviral IFN decoy receptors that prevent the initiation of IFN signaling from type I or II receptors at the cell surface; and (2) poxviral phosphatase that dephosphorylates STAT1 intracellularly. Here, we report a novel mechanism by which poxviruses can inhibit Jak-STAT signaling in response to type I IFN. Myxoma virus (MV) is a highly species-restricted member of the poxvirus family that infects only rabbits under the natural setting. Interestingly, primary human fibroblasts support a permissive MV infection that is only partially sensitive to the antiviral state induced by type I IFN. In this study we show that when type I IFN is added to primary human fibroblasts following MV infection, the tyrosine phosphorylation of the Janus kinase Tyk2 is specifically blocked, thereby preventing the subsequent activation of downstream STAT1 and STAT2. In stark contrast, type II IFN-induced activation of Jak1, Jak2 and STAT1 remains largely unaffected in MV-infected human fibroblasts. Unlike the de-activation of STAT1 by the poxvirus phosphatase, which is delivered into the cell by the input virions, the Tyk2 inhibition by MV infection requires new viral gene expression. Thus, our study documents a previously unrecognized immune evasion mechanism exploited by a poxvirus to selectively disrupt the type I IFN-Jak-STAT signaling cascade.</ab>

<ab>The sensing of pathogen infection and subsequent triggering of innate immunity are key to controlling zoonotic infections. Myxoma virus (MV) is a cytoplasmic DNA poxvirus that in nature infects only rabbits. Our previous studies have shown that MV infection of primary mouse cells is restricted by virus-induced type I interferon (IFN). However, little is known about the innate sensor(s) involved in activating signaling pathways leading to cellular defense responses in primary human immune cells. Here, we show that the complete restriction of MV infection in the primary human fibroblasts requires both tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and type I IFN. We also demonstrate that MV infection of primary human macrophages (pHMs) activates the cytoplasmic RNA sensor called retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I), which coordinately induces the production of both TNF and type I IFN. Of note, RIG-I sensing of MV infection in pHMs initiates a sustained TNF induction through the sequential involvement of the downstream IFN-regulatory factors 3 and 7 (IRF3 and IRF7). Thus, RIG-I-mediated co-induction of TNF and type I IFN by virus-infected pHMs represents a novel innate defense mechanism to restrict viral infection in human cells. These results also reveal a new regulatory mechanism for TNF induction following viral infection.</ab>

<ab>Myxoma virus, a member of the poxvirus family, causes lethal infection only in rabbits, but the mechanism underlying the strict myxoma virus species barrier is not known. Here we show that myxoma virus infection of primary mouse embryo fibroblasts elicited extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) signaling, which was integrated to interferon regulatory factor 3 activation and type I interferon induction. We further show that Erk inactivation or disruption of interferon signaling mediated by the transcription factor STAT1 broke the cellular blockade to myxoma virus multiplication. Moreover, STAT1 deficiency rendered mice highly susceptible to lethal myxoma virus infection. Thus, the Erk-interferon-STAT1 signaling cascade elicited by myxoma virus in nonpermissive primary mouse embryo fibroblasts mediates an innate cellular barrier to poxvirus infection.</ab>

<ab>M11L, a 166-amino-acid antiapoptotic protein of myxoma virus, was previously shown to bind to the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor by hydrophobic interactions at the outer mitochondrial membrane. Here we demonstrate that an additional property of M11L is the ability to constitutively form inhibitory complexes with the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bak in human cells. This binding interaction was identified by both FLAG-tagged pull-down assays and tandem affinity purification from transfected and virus-infected human cells. M11L binds constitutively to human Bak and, under some inducible conditions, to human Bax as well, but not to the other Bcl-2 family members (Bad, Bid, Bcl-2). When stably expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, M11L effectively protects these cells from Fas ligand-induced apoptosis, thereby blocking release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase 9, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. We also demonstrate in coexpression studies that M11L can interact with Bak independently of any involvement with Bax. Furthermore, cells stably expressing M11L function to prevent apoptosis that is induced by overexpression of Bak. We conclude that M11L inhibits, in a species-independent fashion, apoptotic signals mediated by activation of Bak.</ab>

<ab>We demonstrate that the susceptibility of human cancer cells to be infected and killed by an oncolytic poxvirus, myxoma virus (MV), is related to the basal level of endogenous phosphorylated Akt. We further demonstrate that nonpermissive tumor cells will switch from resistant to susceptible for MV infection after expression of ectopically active Akt (Myr-Akt) and that permissive cancer cells can be rendered nonpermissive by blocking Akt activation with a dominant-negative inhibitor of Akt. Finally, the activation of Akt by MV involves the formation of a complex between the viral host range ankyrin-repeat protein, M-T5, and Akt. We conclude that the Akt pathway is a key restriction determinant for permissiveness of human cancer cells by MV.</ab>

<k1>Virus Replication</k1>
<ab>The myxoma virus (MV) ankyrin repeat, host range factor M-T5 has the ability to bind and activate cellular Akt, leading to permissive MV replication in a variety of diverse human cancer cell lines (G. Wang, J. W. Barrett, M. Stanford, S. J. Werden, J. B. Johnston, X. Gao, M. Sun, J. Q. Cheng, and G. McFadden, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 103:4640-4645, 2006). The susceptibility of permissive human cancer cells to MV infection is directly correlated with the basal or induced levels of phosphorylated Akt. When M-T5 is deleted from MV, the knockout virus, vMyxT5KO, can no longer productively infect a subset of human cancer cells (designated type II) that exhibit little or no endogenous phosphorylated Akt. In searching for a host counterpart of M-T5, we noted sequence similarity of M-T5 to a recently identified ankyrin repeat cellular binding protein of Akt called PIKE-A. PIKE-A binds and activates the kinase activity of Akt in a GTP-dependent manner and promotes the invasiveness of human cancer cell lines. Here, we demonstrate that transfected PIKE-A is able to rescue the ability of vMyxT5KO to productively infect type II human cancer cells that were previously resistant to infection. Also, cancer cells that were completely nonpermissive for both wild-type and vMyxT5KO infection (called type III) were rendered fully permissive following ectopic expression of PIKE-A. We conclude that the MV M-T5 host range protein is functionally interchangeable with the host PIKE-A protein and that the activation of host Akt by either M-T5 or PIKE-A is critical for the permissiveness of human cancer cells for MV.</ab>

<ab>Most poxviruses express multiple proteins containing ankyrin (ANK) repeats accounting for a large superfamily of related but unique determinants of poxviral tropism. Recently, select members of this novel family of poxvirus proteins have drawn considerable attention for their potential roles in modulating intracellular signaling networks during viral infection. The rabbit-specific poxvirus, myxoma virus (MYXV), encodes four unique ANK repeat proteins, termed M-T5, M148, M149, and M150, all of which include a carboxy-terminal PRANC domain which closely resembles a cellular protein motif called the F-box domain. Here, we show that each MYXV-encoded ANK repeat protein, including M-T5, interacts directly with the Skp1 component of the host SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, and that the binding of M-T5 to cullin 1 is indirect via binding to Skp1 in the host SCF complex. To understand the significance of these virus-host protein interactions, the various binding domains of M-T5 were mapped. The N-terminal ANK repeats I and II were identified as being important for interaction with Akt, whereas the C-terminal PRANC/F-box-like domain was essential for binding to Skp1. We also report that M-T5 can bind Akt and the host SCF complex (via Skp1) simultaneously in MYXV-infected cells. Finally, we report that M-T5 specifically mediates the relocalization of Akt from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during infection with the wild-type MYXV, but not the M-T5 knockout version of the virus. These results indicate that ANK/PRANC proteins play a critical role in reprogramming disparate cellular signaling cascades to establish a new cellular environment more favorable for virus replication.</ab>

<ab>Viruses have evolved an assortment of mechanisms for regulating the Akt signaling pathway to establish a cellular environment more favorable for viral replication. Myxoma virus (MYXV) is a rabbit-specific poxvirus that encodes many immunomodulatory factors, including an ankyrin repeat-containing host range protein termed M-T5 that functions to regulate tropism of MYXV for rabbit lymphocytes and certain human cancer cells. MYXV permissiveness in these human cancer cells is dependent upon the direct interaction between M-T5 and Akt, which has been shown to induce the kinase activity of Akt. In this study, an array of compounds that selectively manipulate Akt signaling was screened and we show that only a subset of Akt inhibitors significantly decreased the ability of MYXV to replicate in previously permissive human cancer cells. Furthermore, reduced viral replication efficiency was correlated with lower levels of phosphorylated Akt. In contrast, the PP2A-specific phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid promoted increased Akt kinase activation and rescued MYXV replication in human cancer cells that did not previously support viral replication. Finally, phosphorylation of Akt at residue Thr308 was shown to dictate the physical interaction between Akt and M-T5, which then leads to phosphorylation of Ser473 and permits productive MYXV replication in these human cancer cells. The results of this study further characterize the mechanism by which M-T5 exploits the Akt signaling cascade and affirms this interaction as a major tropism determinant that regulates the replication efficiency of MYXV in human cancer cells.</ab>

<ab>Poxviruses demonstrate strict species specificity in vivo that range from narrow to broad, however the fundamental factors that mediate the basis of poxvirus tropism remain poorly understood. It is generally believed that most, if not all, poxviruses can efficiently bind and enter a wide range of mammalian cells and all of the known host anti-viral pathways that block viral replication in nonpremissive cells operate downstream of virus entry. A productive poxvirus infection is heavily dependent upon the production of a vast array of host modulatory products that specifically target and manipulate both extracellular immune response pathways of the host, as well as intracellular signal transduction pathways of the individually infected cells. The unique pathogenesis and host tropism of specific poxviruses can be attributed to the broad diversity of host modulatory proteins they express. Myxoma virus (MV) is a rabbit-specific poxviruses that encodes multiple host range factors, including an ankyrin-repeat protein M-T5, which functions to regulate tropism of MV for rabbit lymphocytes and some human cancer cells. At the molecular level, M-T5 binds and alters at least two distinct cellular proteins: Akt and cullin-1. The direct interaction between M-T5 and Akt was shown to be a key restriction determinant for MV tropism in a spectrum of human cancer cells making MV an excellent oncolytic candidate. Thus, the intricate relationship between viral encoded proteins and components of the host cell signaling networks can have profound impact on poxvirus tropism. The lessons we continue to learn from poxvirus host range factors like M-T5 will provide further insights into the factors that regulate poxvirus tropism and the mechanisms by which poxviruses micromanipulate the signaling pathways of the infected cell.</ab>

<ab>As a family of viruses, poxviruses collectively exhibit a broad host range and most of the individual members are capable of replicating in a wide array of cell types from various host species, at least in vitro. At the cellular level, poxvirus tropism is dependent not upon specific cell surface receptors, but rather upon: (1) the ability of the cell to provide intracellular complementing factors needed for productive virus replication, and (2) the ability of the specific virus to successfully manipulate intracellular signaling networks that regulate cellular antiviral processes downstream of virus entry. The large genomic coding capacity of poxviruses enables the virus to express a unique collection of viral proteins that function as host range factors, which specifically target and manipulate host signaling pathways to establish optimal cellular conditions for viral replication. Functionally, the known host range factors from poxviruses have been associated with manipulation of a diverse array of cellular targets, which includes cellular kinases and phosphatases, apoptosis, and various antiviral pathways. To date, only a small number of poxvirus host range genes have been identified and studied, and only a handful of these have been functionally characterized. For this reason, poxvirus host range factors represent a potential gold mine for the discovery of novel pathogen-host protein interactions. This review summarizes our current understanding of the mechanisms by which the known poxvirus host range genes, and their encoded factors, expand tropism through the manipulation of host cell intracellular signaling pathways.</ab>

<ab>We have determined the complete DNA sequence of the Leporipoxvirus Shope fibroma virus (SFV). The SFV genome spans 159.8 kb and encodes 165 putative genes of which 13 are duplicated in the 12.4-kb terminal inverted repeats. Although most SFV genes have homologs encoded by other Chordopoxvirinae, the SFV genome lacks a key gene required for the production of extracellular enveloped virus. SFV also encodes only the smaller ribonucleotide reductase subunit and has a limited nucleotide biosynthetic capacity. SFV preserves the Chordopoxvirinae gene order from S012L near the left end of the chromosome through to S142R (homologs of vaccinia F2L and B1R, respectively). The unique right end of SFV appears to be genetically unstable because when the sequence is compared with that of myxoma virus, five myxoma homologs have been deleted (C. Cameron, S. Hota-Mitchell, L. Chen, J. Barrett, J.-X. Cao, C. Macaulay, D. Willer, D. Evans, and G. McFadden, 1999, Virology 264, 298-318). Most other differences between these two Leporipoxviruses are located in the telomeres. Leporipoxviruses encode several genes not found in other poxviruses including four small hydrophobic proteins of unknown function (S023R, S119L, S125R, and S132L), an alpha 2, 3-sialyltransferase (S143R), a protein belonging to the Ig-like protein superfamily (S141R), and a protein resembling the DNA-binding domain of proteins belonging to the HIN-200 protein family S013L). SFV also encodes a type II DNA photolyase (S127L). Melanoplus sanguinipes entomopoxvirus encodes a similar protein, but SFV is the first mammalian virus potentially capable of photoreactivating ultraviolet DNA damage.</ab>

<ab>DNA from several independent strains of Shope fibroma virus, a tumorogenic leporipoxvirus of rabbits, was isolated and analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion and Southern blotting. The restriction profiles indicated a high degree of sequence conservation among the isolates but blotting under standard stringencies revealed no detectable cross homology with a member of the orthopoxvirus group, vaccinia. The genome of the fibroma virus was calculated to be in excess of 160 kilobases and shown to possess two features analogous to the orthopoxvirus group: (1) the terminal restriction fragments possess covalently closed hairpin structures; and (2) the terminal sequences are present as inverted repeats of greater than 10 kilobases. The terminal 3.6 kilobase BamHI restriction fragment was cloned in pBR322 after removal of the hairpin structure with mung bean single strand-specific endonuclease and addition of BamHI linkers. SFV sequences within this terminal region were shown, using 32P SFV cloned terminal probe, to have none of the sequence heterogeneity characteristic of vaccinia DNA termini. The remaining 20 internal SFV BamHI restriction fragments were propagated in bacterial plasmids either as intact fragments, or after secondary digestion with HindIII, and together constitute the complete cloned SFV sequence library.</ab>

<ab>BACKGROUND: Viral oncolytic therapy, which seeks to exploit the use of live viruses to treat cancer, has shown promise in the treatment of cancers resistant to conventional anticancer therapies. Among the most difficult to treat cancers is advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Our study investigates the ability of a novel oncolytic agent, myxoma virus, to infect, productively replicate in, and kill human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. METHODS: The myxoma virus vMyxgfp was tested against a panel of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines. Infectivity, viral proliferation, and tumor cell kill were assessed. RESULTS: Infection of tumor cells was assessed by expression of the marker gene enhanced green fluorescent protein (e-GFP). vMyxgfp had the ability to infect all pancreatic cancer cell lines tested. Killing of tumor cells varied among the 6 cell lines tested, ranging from &amp;gt;90% cell kill at 7 days for the most sensitive Panc-1 cells, to 39% in the most resistant cell line Capan-2. Sensitivity correlated to replication of virus, and was found to maximally exhibit a four-log increase in foci-forming units for the most sensitive Panc-1 cells within 72 h. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates for the first time the ability of the myxoma virus to productively infect, replicate in, and lyse human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells in vitro. These data encourage further investigation of this virus, which is pathogenic only in rabbits, for treatment of this nearly uniformly fatal cancer.</ab>

<ab>PURPOSE: Rhabdoid tumors are highly aggressive pediatric tumors that are usually refractory to available treatments. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of two oncolytic viruses, myxoma virus (MV) and an attenuated vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV(DeltaM51)), in experimental models of human rhabdoid tumor. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Four human rhabdoid tumor cell lines were cultured in vitro and treated with live or inactivated control virus. Cytopathic effect, viral gene expression, infectious viral titers, and cell viability were examined at various time points after infection. To study viral oncolysis in vivo, human rhabdoid tumor cells were implanted s.c. in the hind flank or intracranially in CD-1 nude mice and treated with intratumoral (i.t.) or i.v. injections of live or UV-inactivated virus. Viral distribution and effects on tumor size and survival were assessed. RESULTS: All rhabdoid tumor cell lines tested in vitro were susceptible to productive lethal infections by MV and VSV(DeltaM51). I.t. injection of live MV or VSV(DeltaM51) dramatically reduced the size of s.c. rhabdoid tumor xenografts compared with control animals. I.v. administration of VSV(DeltaM51) or i.t. injection of MV prolonged the median survival of mice with brain xenografts compared with controls (VSV(DeltaM51): 25 days versus 21 days, log-rank test, P = 0.0036; MV: median survival not reached versus 21 days, log-rank test, P = 0.0007). Most of the MV-treated animals (4 of 6; 66.7%) were alive and apparently &amp;quot;cured&amp;quot; when the experiment was arbitrarily ended (&amp;gt;180 days). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that VSV(DeltaM51) and MV could be novel effective therapies against human rhabdoid tumor.</ab>

<ab>Myxoma virus, a member of the poxvirus family of DNA viruses, encodes many virulence factors to combat and evade the host immune responses. Among the virus-encoded immuno-modulators is M-T2, a tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) homologue. M-T2 is secreted as monomeric and dimeric species that bind and inhibit rabbit TNF in a species-specific manner. Deletion analysis indicates that the anti-TNF function is mediated by the first three of four cysteine rich domains (CRDs) of M-T2. In addition, the intracellular form of M-T2 has the ability to block virus-induced apoptosis in lymphocytes, and the first two CRDs appear to be sufficient for this function. Although the mechanisms for the anti-TNF and anti-apoptotic functions of M-T2 are not yet fully defined, we postulate that these dual activities of M-T2 are mediated through different functional motifs and abrogate distinct cellular responses to virus infection.</ab>

<ab>The M141 protein of myxoma virus (MYXV) is a viral CD200 homolog (also called vOX-2) that inhibits macrophage activation in infected rabbits. Here, we show that murine myeloid RAW 264.7 cells became activated when infected with MYXV in which the M141 gene was deleted (vMyx-M141KO) but not with the parental wild-type MYXV. Moreover, transcript and protein levels of tumor necrosis factor and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor were rapidly upregulated in an NF-kappaB-dependent fashion in the RAW 264.7 cells infected with vMyx-M141KO. M141 protein is present in the virion and counteracts this NF-kappaB activation pathway upon infection with the wild-type MYXV. Our data suggest that upregulation of these classic macrophage-related proinflammatory cytokine markers following infection of myeloid cells with the M141-knockout MYXV is mediated via the rapid activation of the cellular NF-kappaB pathway.</ab>

<ab>Post-translational polypeptide tagging by conjugation with ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like (Ub/Ubl) molecules is a potent way to alter protein functions and/or sort specific protein targets to the proteasome for degradation. Many poxviruses interfere with the host Ub/Ubl system by encoding viral proteins that can usurp this pathway. Some of these include viral proteins of the membrane-associated RING-CH (MARCH) domain, p28/Really Interesting New Gene (RING) finger, ankyrin-repeat/F-box and Broad-complex, Tramtrack and Bric-a-Brac (BTB)/Kelch subgroups of the E3 Ub ligase superfamily. Here we describe and discuss the various strategies used by poxviruses to target and subvert the host cell Ub/Ubl systems.</ab>

<ab>Vaccinia virus, a large double-stranded DNA virus, is the prototype of the Orthopoxvirus genus, which includes several pathogenic poxviruses of humans, such as monkeypox virus and variola virus. Here, we report a comprehensive yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening for the protein-protein interactions between vaccinia and human proteins. A total of 109 novel vaccinia-human protein interactions were detected among 33 viral proteins. To validate subsets of those interactions, we constructed an ORFeome library of vaccinia virus strain WR using the Gateway plasmid cloning system. By co-expressing selected vaccinia and host proteins in a variety of expression systems, we found that at least 17 of the Y2H hits identified between vaccinia and human proteins can be verified by independent methods using GST pull-down assays, representing a 63% validation rate for the Y2H hits examined (17/27). Because the cloned ORFs are conveniently transferable from the entry vectors to various destination expression vectors, the vaccinia ORFeome library will be a useful resource for future high-throughput functional proteomic experiments.</ab>

<ab>The highly immunosuppressive leporipoxvirus myxoma, previously was shown to promote the loss of cell surface class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC I) molecules. Here, we show that myxoma virus induces the loss of both cell surface and intracellular post-Golgi, beta(2)-microglobulin-associated MHC I. Myxoma-induced loss of these MHC I molecules is abrogated by vacuolar ATPase inhibitors, NH(4)Cl, and leupeptin. Furthermore, immunofluorescence microscopic studies reveal that in myxoma-infected cells, beta(2)-microglobulin-associated MHC I accumulates in Lamp-1(+) vesicular structures, suggesting that myxoma virus targets MHC I for degradation in late endosomes and/or lysosomes. These events are regulated by early gene product or products because they occur unabated in cells infected with myxoma virus in the presence of cytosine arabinoside, an inhibitor of DNA synthesis. Studies with baby green monkey kidney cells transfected with wild-type and tail-less forms of a mouse MHC I molecule, H-2L(d), indicate that the MHC I cytoplasmic tail is required for myxoma-induced localization in Lamp-1(+) organelles. Myxoma-induced endocytosis and degradation of MHC I may provide the virus with a means of dispensing with cell surface MHC I molecules that were loaded with peptides derived from viral proteins synthesized early in infection.</ab>
