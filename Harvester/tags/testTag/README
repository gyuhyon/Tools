VIVO Harvester
VIVO: Enabling National Networking of Scientists

Quick start
See this wiki page for a user guide to the harvester
https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/vivo/index.php?title=VIVO_Harvester_User_Guide

For example, 
	to harvest all of your institution data from pubmed into your vivo instance, you need to minimally do the following things:

Edit config/models/vivo.xml and set it to point to your vivo database
Edit config/tasks/example.pubmedfetch.xml and change the options as follows:

	<Param id="email">YOUREMAIL</Param>
	<Param id="output">config/recordHandlers/PubmedXMLRecordHandler.xml</Param>
	<Param id="termSearch">YOURPUBMEDQUERY</Param>
	<Param id="numRecords">ALL</Param>
	<Param id="batchSize">1000</Param>
	
run scripts/run-pubmed.sh

The termSearch is the same search string you would use on pubmed.
